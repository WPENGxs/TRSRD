        "abstract": "Pesticide management is a crucial issue for sustainable agriculture and food safety. The high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based screening method has become a popular choice to monitor pesticide residues in foods and the environment. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) was the first option allowing for this type of analysis due to the wide compound coverage compared to traditional targeted analysis using triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (QqQ). However, a higher false-positive detection rate is a critical shortcoming in DIA. To overcome this concern, a rigorous method is needed to determine the reliable information acquired from DIA screening. A systematic strategy, traceable and integrated pesticide screening (TIPS), was proposed in this study to comprehensively monitor pesticides and metabolites in a complex tea matrix, avoiding false-positive detection. A total of 900 pesticides were added to an in-house database and evaluated through precision tests, which showed good repeatability and reproducibility. One hundred pesticides and metabolites were detected and confirmed by TIPS in 98 commercial tea samples. In addition to the authorized pesticides that could be detected in TIPS, chlorfluazuron, diafenthiuron, and tolfenpyrad, which are pesticides not allowed to be used in tea farming, were frequently found in this study. In addition, dinotefuran DN and fenbuconazole metabolites RH-9129 and/or RH-9130 were tentatively identified in the archived data using retrospective analysis. The HRMS-based data in TIPS could be a record platform for tracing novel or emerging contaminants not initially targeted in samples. TIPS, a novel strategy, has great potential for rapidly conducting a risk assessment of unexpected pesticides in food.",

        "abstract": "Despite tea beneficial health effects, there is a substantial risk of tea contamination by harmful pathogens and mycotoxins. A total of 40 tea samples (17 green (raw) tea; 13 black (fermented) tea; 10 herbal infusions or white tea) were purchased from different markets located in Lisbon district during 2020. All products were directly available to consumers either in bulk (13) and or in individual packages (27). Bacterial analysis was performed by inoculating 150 μL of samples extracts in tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with 0.2 % nystatin medium for mesophilic bacteria, and in Violet Red bile agar (VRBA) medium for coliforms (Gram-negative bacteria). Fungal research was performed by spreading 150 μL of samples in malt extract agar (MEA) supplemented with 0.05 % chloramphenicol and in dichloran-glycerol agar (DG18) media. The molecular detection of the Aspergillus sections Fumigati, Nidulantes, Circumdati and Flavi was carried out by Real Time PCR (qPCR). Detection of mycotoxins was performed using high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with a mass spectrometry detector. Azole resistance screening was achieved following the EUCAST guidelines. The highest counts of total bacteria (TSA) were obtained in green raw tea (81.6 %), while for coliform counts (VRBA) were found in samples from black raw tea (96.2 %). The highest fungal counts were obtained in green raw tea (87.7 % MEA; 69.6 % DG18). Aspergillus sp. was the most prevalent genus in all samples on MEA (54.3 %) and on DG18 (56.2 %). In the raw tea 23 of the samples (57.5 %) presented contamination by one to five mycotoxins in the same sample. One Aspergillus section Fumigati isolate from green tea beverage recovered form itraconazole-Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) medium, presented itraconazole and posaconazole E-test MICs above MIC90 values. Our findings open further discussion regarding the One-Health approach and the necessary investment in researching biological hazards and azole-resistance associated with the production and consumption of tea (in particular green tea).",

The ATP-POPM exhibited superior extraction capacity toward phenylurea herbicides (PUHs). A sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of six PUHs in water, tea drink and mushroom samples was developed with ATP-POPM as solid phase extraction adsorbent prior to high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection. Under the optimized conditions, the linear response of PUHs was 0.09-80.0 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> for water, 0.18-100.0 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> for tea drinks and 4.50-200.0 ng g <sup>-1</sup> for mushroom samples.

        "abstract": "Pu-erh tea belongs to dark tea among six major teas in China. As an important kind of post-fermented tea with complex microbial composition, Pu-erh tea is highly praised by many consumers owing to its unique and rich flavor and taste. In recent years, Pu-erh tea has exhibited various physiological activities to prevent and treat metabolic diseases. This review focuses on the fungi in Pu-erh tea and introduces the sources, types, and functions of fungi in Pu-erh tea, as well as the influence on the quality of Pu-erh tea and potential safety risks. During the process of fermentation and aging of Pu-erh tea, fungi contribute to complex chemical changes in bioactive components of tea. Therefore, we examine the important role that fungi play in the quality formation of Pu-erh tea. The associations among the microbial composition, chemicals excreted, and potential food hazards are discussed during the pile-fermentation of Pu-erh tea. The quality of Pu-erh tea has exhibited profound changes during the process of pile-fermentation, including color, aroma, taste, and the bottom of the leaves, which are inseparable from the fungus in the pile-fermentation of Pu-erh tea. Specifically, the application prospects of various detection methods of mycotoxins in assessing the safety of Pu-erh tea are proposed. This review aims to fully understand the importance of fungi in the production of Pu-erh tea and further provides new insights into subtly regulating the piling process to improve the nutritional properties and guarantee the safety of Pu-erh tea.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the QuEChERS method was modified and evaluated for the determination of 186 pesticides from caffeine-free and fatty hawk tea prior to their gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis for the first time. The results showed that the combination of MgSO<sub>4</sub> + PSA + MWCNTs plus EMR-Lipid provided the lowest matrix effect and best recovery; 117 of 186 pesticides manifested weak matrix effects. Thus, for accurate quantification, it is necessary to use matrix-matched calibration curves to compensate for the matrix effect. At the spiked level of 0.1 mg/kg, the average recoveries of 184 pesticides were in the range of 70-120% and the RSDs were 0.3-14.4% by the modified method. Good linearity was shown for 186 analytes at concentration of 0.01 mg/L~0.4 mg/L, and the correlation coefficients exceeded 0.99 for 182 pesticides. The detection limits of 186 pesticides by the modified QuEChERS method were 0.001-0.02 mg/kg, and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.005 mg/kg~0.05 mg/kg.

        "abstract": "To evaluate metal(loid) contamination in tea leaves and assess health risks of tea drinking in China, metal(loid) concentrations in tea leaves from major tea-producing provinces were determined. Nine metal(loid)s (Al, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb) were measured in a total of 217 tea samples representing five tea varieties (black tea, dark tea, green tea, oolong tea and white tea) from seven major tea-producing provinces of China (Fujian, Guangdong, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Yunnan and Zhejiang). The results indicated that tea samples from Hunan Province had the highest metal(loid) concentrations, likely due its high prevalence of heavy industrial activities and soil pollution. The concentrations of As and Pb in dark tea were markedly higher than those in other tea varieties. A strong Spearman correlation coefficient (0.78, P < 0.001) of As and Pb in all the tea varieties has also been found, indicating their similar sources. Human health risk assessment for the nine analyzed metal(loid)s indicated that co-exposure to these metal(loids) may not cause significant health risks (hazard index [HI] > 1 suggests considerable health risks). Among the five tea varieties, metal(loids)s in dark and green tea induced relatively higher health risks, with 90th percentile HI values approached 0.8. Co (53.6 %-84.5 %) and Al (3.33 %-15.8 %) made the highest contributions to the HI of the selected tea commodities. Thus, public and regulatory agencies should reduce excessive Co and Al accumulation in these tea varieties during cultivation and production processes.",

Tea is one of the world's most popular nonalcoholic beverages, where folpet is not listed as an applicable pesticide. To demonstrate how serious false-positives and overestimation in dietary risk are caused by the application of a new residue definition, the residue pattern of PI in made tea and processed tea leaves, along with its transfer rate during tea brewing and corresponding dietary risk, were investigated in the present study. The results revealed that PI residue in tea ranged from <10 μg/kg to 180 μg/kg with a median value of 10 μg/kg, 7.3 % of which was over the maximum residue limit established by EU (100 μg/kg, expressed as folpet). The PI residue in green tea was obviously higher than that in black, dark and oolong tea. Simulated heating experiments revealed that PI can arise from improper heating of folpet-free fresh tea leaves, and thus green tea bears a higher risk for its manufacturing employing a comparatively higher temperature. The transfer rate of PI during tea brewing was 104 ± 14 %. Nevertheless, the risk of PI through drinking tea was negligible to humans depending on the risk quotient (RQ) value, which was significantly lower than 1.",

        "abstract": "Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a popular beverage that is consumed globally. However, a better understanding of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) content in tea leaves and infusion is necessary to minimize risk on human health. Therefore, 249 tea samples (grown in different areas) covering six types of tea were collected in China to investigate the PTEs contents, identify their potential source and assess the health risk associated with drinking tea. PTE contents in tea leaves across six tea types were ND-0.900 (Cd), 0.005-2.133 (As), ND-5.679 (Pb), ND-13.86 (Cr), 1.601-22.93 (Ni), ND-2.048 (Se), 0.109-622.4 (F), 13.02-269.9 (Rb), 1.845-50.88 (Sr), and 2.796-53.23 (Ba) mg/kg. The result of tea infusion showed that 14.3 %-44.1 % (green tea), 14.5 %-46.7 % (black tea), 10.5 %-25.3 % (dark tea), 13.6 %-34.2 % (oolong tea), 16.9 %-40.7 % (yellow tea), and 19.9 %-35.1 % (white tea) of F were released. All tea types, except green tea, exhibited comparatively low leachability of Cd, As, Pb and Cr in tea infusion. The source apportionment revealed that PTEs in tea leaves mainly originated from soil parental materials, while industrial activities, fertilizer application, and manufacturing processes may contribute to exogenous Se, Cd, As, and Cr accumulation. Health risk assessment indicated that F in tea infusion dominated the health risk. Humans may be exposed to a higher health risk by drinking green tea compared to that of other tea types. Nevertheless, the long-term tea consumption is less likely to contribute to pronounced non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. This study confirmed that tea consumption is an important and direct pathway of PTEs uptake in humans. The health risk associated with drinking tea should be of concern.",

        "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that pesticide residues in tea exceeding the maximum residue limits (MRL) can cause harmful effects on the human body. There are many limitations in the existing analytical methods for pesticide residues in tea, so new analytical methods need to be developed. We developed a limit test method that combines thin-layer chromatography with Raman imaging microscopy (TLC-RIM). Seven residual pesticide components in tea (Avermectin, Methomyl, Carbendazim, Imidacloprid, Chlorothalonil, Azoxystrobin, and Acetamiprid) could be preliminarily separated by TLC and then irradiated by a 532 nm laser. Raman spectra of seven pesticides obtained by Raman imaging microscopy could be used to test whether the pesticide residues in tea exceed the MRL. The limits of detection of the seven pesticides were 0.04, 0.10, 0.24, 0.20, 0.12, 0.12, and 1.0 mg/mL, respectively. The simulated positive test showed that the matrix in tea did not interfere with the test of the seven pesticides. When the pesticides were tested within 8 h, the RSD of the peak heights of the seven pesticides were 1.2%~9.6%; the test results of three batches of tea showed that the imidacloprid in one batch of tea exceeded its MRL, and the results were consistent with that by UPLC-MS/MS. The TLC-RIM is fast, sensitive, stable, specific, and reliable.",

However, little information on PCN concentrations in green tea, a popular beverage worldwide is available. In this study, all 75 PCN congener concentrations and distributions in green tea samples (n = 102) from 11 regions in China were determined, and risk assessment of human exposure to PCNs through tea consumption was conducted. The PCN concentrations in all the green tea samples were 3.62-175 pg/g dry weight (mean 36.1 pg/g dry weight). Similar PCN homolog and congener profiles were found in green tea samples from different areas. The dominant PCN homologs in all of the green tea samples were di-CNs, tetra-CNs, and tri-CNs. No direct relationships were found between PCN emission sources and PCN concentrations in the green tea samples. The brewing technique could affect the PCN concentrations and homolog profiles in tea leaves. PCNs in green tea from China were found to pose little risk to humans.",

Contamination of multiple heavy metals in tea leaves is frequently reported. However, the dietary exposure risk that heavy metals in Tieguanyin tea (a famous type of oolong tea,) pose to different subpopulations has not been explored. In this study, contaminations of five heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Cr, Cd, and Ni) of concern in Tieguanyin tea were monitored, then the related health risk was assessed for six different subpopulations based on tea brewing experiments and a previous consumption survey. Results show that the mean levels found were as follows: 8.18 mg/kg (Cu), 0.84 mg/kg (Pb), 0.51 mg/kg (Cr), 0.04 mg/kg (Cd), and 1.90 mg/kg (Ni), respectively, and their transfer rates during tea brewing varied within 10.2-70.4%. All estimated daily intakes of individual targeted elements via Tieguanying tea consumption were far below their corresponding tolerable limits. The adjusted hazard index value ranged from 1.1 × 10<sup>-2</sup> to 1.7 × 10<sup>-2</sup>, indicating that exposure to these five elements via drinking Tieguanyin tea would not pose significant non-cancer risks for six subpopulations under the current consumption habit. In addition, the carcinogenic risks associated with heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and Cr) were acceptable because no total cancer risk values exceeded the 10<sup>-4</sup> threshold. However, in order to improve consumer protection, we still suggest that considerable attention should be paid to Pb, Ni, and Cd because of their high concentration in infusion, high extraction rate, and major carcinogenic risk contribution, respectively.",

Organic amendments application is considered a practical way to mitigate the above adverse consequence. However, the trade-off between agronomic and environmental effects on the application of the organic amendments is still under debate. Herein, we conducted a long-term field experiment with four treatments, including control (without and fertiliser) (CK), chemical fertiliser treatment (CF), chicken manure treatment (CM) and chicken manure combined with biochar treatment (CMB) to investigate the effects of organic amendments application on soil quality, heavy metal contamination and tea production in a tea plantation. Totally 16 plots were arranged randomly with a completely randomised design. The results showed that CM and CMB treatments improved soil nutrient, mitigated soil acidification and ameliorated soil porosity compared to CF treatment. CMB treatment displayed a relatively high tea yield and quality in three consecutive years of monitoring. However, CM and CMB treatments elevated the heavy metal (HM) potential ecological risk (RI) and Nemerow's composite index (Ps). CM treatment significantly increased available As, Pb, Cu and Zn concentrations compared to CF treatment, while CMB treatment significantly decreased available Cr and Cu concentrations and slightly decreased available Cd, Pb and Ni concentrations compared to CM treatment. But the increase of available As and Zn in CMB treatment compared to CM treatment also indicated adverse effects of biochar addition. The PLS-PM model showed HM risk had direct negative effects on tea quality. Moreover, soil fungal community revealed positive effects on tea yield and negative effects on tea quality. Overall, our study proved that CMB treatment could improve soil quality, reduce available Cr and Ni concentrations, maintain tea yield and increase tea quality.",

However, our knowledge of its impact on humans, in particular, is still very limited. Thus, while we have not gathered definitive information on their consequences, studies that aim to identify the MP's sources constitute subsidies to better understand the various exposure pathways to these pollutants. Thus, we investigated the possible presence of MP-like particles in teabag samples (of different brands) obtained in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Surprisingly, all analyzed samples (five brands) were contaminated with MPs. Fragments and fibers were identified in a higher percentage, and a wide variety of colors was identified, with a predominance of brown, blue, and red colors. Scanning electron microscope images of teabags exhibited net-like structures of fiber particles with a smooth surface. Furthermore, we observed irregularly shaped MPs and rougher surfaces and fragments in the process of detachment from the main fiber, oxidation flakes, and fracture-like. The average size of these pollutants was between 200.6 and 220.7 μm, and the polymer types identified via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were polytetrafluoroethylene, high-density polyethylene, polycarbonate, nylon, polyvinyl chloride, polytetrafluoroethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate, cellulose acetate, and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, the last three being the most frequent in the analyzed samples. Finally, we noticed that MPs from tea bags in Dhaka could cause an average emission of 10.9 million grams of MPs/year. Although the teabags analyzed in our study are not \"complemented with the appealing flavor of MPs\", it is very likely that tea ingestion in Dhaka is accompanied by the concomitant ingestion of plastic particles making teabags an important route of human exposure to these micropollutants.",

Eighty-six samples were collected and analyzed, including the following kinds: black, green, white, Pu-erh, and Yerba Mate. The samples came from Poland. The Hg concentration was determined with an AMA 254 atomic absorption spectrometer. The study showed that the Hg content in each tea sample averaged 2.47 μg/kg. The Hg concentration in the tested types of tea differed significantly statistically (<i>p</i> = 0.000). It was the largest in Yerba Mate, followed by green, Pu-erh, and white tea, and was the smallest in black tea. Statistically significant differences in the Hg content (<i>p</i> = 0.004) were also dependent on the form of the product; in leaf tea samples, the concentration of Hg (2.54 µg/kg) was higher than in tea bags (1.16 µg/kg). The Hg concentration determined in the tested samples does not exceed the permitted EU standard. Consuming these teas poses no health risk in terms of the amount of Hg.",

        "abstract": "Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin, with several acute, chronic, and cellular level toxic effects, produced by various fungi. A limit for PAT in food of has been set by authorities to guarantee food safety. Research on PAT in tea has been very limited although tea is the second largest beverage in the world. In this paper, HPLC-DAD and GC-MS methods for analysis of PAT in different tea products, such as non-fermented (green tea), partially fermented (oolong tea, white tea, yellow tea), completely fermented (black tea), and post-fermented (dark tea and Pu-erh tea) teas were developed. The methods showed good selectivity with regard to tea pigments and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and a recovery of 90-102% for PAT at a 10-100 ppb spiking level. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) in tea were 1.5 ng/g and 5.0 ng/g for HPLC-UV, and 0.25 ng/g and 0.83 ng/g for GC-MS. HPLC was simpler and more robust, while GC-MS showed higher sensitivity and selectivity. GC-MS was used to validate the HPLC-UV method and prove its accuracy. The PAT content of 219 Chinese tea samples was investigated. Most tea samples contained less than 10 ng/g, ten more than 10 ng/g and two more than 50 ng/g. The results imply that tea products in China are safe with regard to their PAT content. Even an extreme daily consumption of 25 g of the tea with the highest PAT content (124 ng/g), translates to an intake of only 3 μg/person/day, which is still an order of magnitude below the maximum allowed daily intake of 30 µg for an adult.",

        "abstract": "Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is one of the most widely consumed non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. In the present study, 73 commercial tea samples were collected from tea plantations in the Southwest, South, Jiangnan, and Jiangbei regions of China. The contents of four macroelements (phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg)) and 15 trace metals (arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), aluminium (Al), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), thorium (Th), thallium (Tl), rubidium (Rb) and barium (Ba)) in tea samples were determined. The mean concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Zn, Al, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Th, Tl, Rb and Ba were in the range of 0.02-0.61, 0.008-0.126, 0.09-1.12, 0.001-0.012, 0.07-1.62, 19.5-73.2, 170-2100, 5.9-43.3, 228-2040, 60-337, 2.09-17.95, 0.002-0.08, 0.004-0.409, 0-150.50 and 3.1-41.2 µg/g, respectively, which were all lower than the maximum permissible limits stipulated by China (NY/T 288-2012, NY 659-2003). The target hazard quotients of each heavy metal were lower than one, and the combined risk hazard index of all heavy metals for adults was in the range of 0.10-0.85; therefore, there was no significant carcinogenic health risks to tea drinking consumers under the current dietary intake. Significant differences were found in the content of trace elements (Zn, Cu, Fe, Ni, Th, Tl, Rb and Ba) (p < 0.05); however, no significant differences were found in the content of macroelements (P, K, Ca and Mg) and trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Al and Mn) in teas from different regions. Therefore, the region did not affect the heavy metal exposure risk. Correlation coefficient and principal component analyses were performed to determine the source of the elements. Three principal factors were obtained: factor 1 was positively related to Ca, Mg, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Al, Mn, Fe and Th (32.63%); factor 2 to P, Zn, Cu and Ni (18.64%) and factor 3 to K and Rb (10.10%). Thus, the elements in the same factor might originate from the same source. This study provides an essential basis to understand the variance and potential risks of different elements in tea from different regions of China.",

The average recoveries of chlorantraniliprole were in the range of 86-110%, with the precision of intraday (n = 5) and interday (n = 15) ranging from 1.9 to 8.4% and from 2.4 to 8.8%, respectively.

The limits of quantification (LOQs) were all 0.01 mg/kg. The results based on the supervised field trials showed that chlorantraniliprole and indoxacarb in two tea samples followed first-order kinetics models with half-lives of 2.2-4.7 days and 2.5-3.5 days, which could be regarded as a moderately degrading pesticide. The terminal residues of chlorantraniliprole and indoxacarb in made tea were below 6.7 and 4.5 mg/kg, respectively, lower than their corresponding maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by several major countries and organizations (50 and 5 mg/kg). The leaching rates of chlorantraniliprole and indoxacarb during the tea brewing ranged from 4.78 to 12.62% and 4.13 to 10.67%, respectively. The chronic intake risk quotient (RQc) values for chlorantraniliprole and indoxacarb were 0.24% and 35.10%, while the acute dietary risk assessment (RQa) value of indoxacarb was 5.8%, which were all much lower than 100%.

We apply Geographic information systems technology to study the distribution of heavy metal elements in tea plantation ecosystems in Jiangsu Province, explore the relationships among metals in the soil, tea leaves and tea infusions, and assess the human safety risks of metals. The concentrations of nine metals in a soil-tea leaves-tea infusion system were studied at 100 randomly selected tea plantations in Jiangsu Province, China. Concentrations of selected metals, zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu), were quantified using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), and cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), plumbum (Pb) and mercury (Hg) were quantified using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Arc-Map 10.3 was used for the spatial analysis of metals in soil, tea leaves and tea infusions. We found that the contents of Mn, Ni and Zn are high level in soil, tea leaves and tea infusions. The Mn level showed a spatial distribution pattern with greater concentrations at the junction of Nanjing and Yangzhou, southwest of Changzhou and west of Suzhou. The hazard index (HI) values in north-central Nanjing, southern Suzhou, southwestern Changzhou and northern Lianyungang were relatively greater. The Zn, Ni, Mn, Cr and Cu levels in the soil-tea infusion system were 17.3, 45.5, 54.5, 1.5 and 14.3%, respectively. The order of the leaching rates of the elements was Ni > Cr > Zn > Mn > Cu. The relative contribution ratios of HI were in the order of Mn > Ni > Cu > Zn > Cr > Pb > Cd > As > Hg. In tea infusions, the Mn level has the greatest potential health risks to consumers.

        "abstract": "Four pesticides with a high detection rate in Pu'er tea have been determined by a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe) method with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and combined ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole linear ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS). MWCNs have been compared with other common purification materials, and found to be superior. The matrix effect was systematically studied, and the results show that the MWCNs can quickly and effectively reduce matrix interference values, which were in the range from -17.8 to 13.8. The coefficients (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>) were greater than 0.99, with the limit of quantification ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 μg/kg, and the recovery rate ranging from 74.8% to 105.0%, while the relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 3.9% to 6.6%. A total of 300 samples, taken from three areas in which Yunnan Pu'er tea was most commonly produced, tested for four pesticides. The results show that the detection rate of tolfenpyrad in Pu'er tea was 35.7%, which is higher than other pesticides, and the lowest was indoxacarb, with 5.2%. The residual concentrations of chlorpyrifos, triazophos, tolfenpyrad and indoxacarb ranged from 1.10 to 5.28, 0.014 to 0.103, 1.02 to 51.8, and 1.07 to 4.89 mg/kg, respectively. By comparing with China's pesticide residue limits in tea (GB 2763-2021), the over standard rates of chlorpyrifos, tolfenpyrad, and indoxacarb were 4.35%, 0.87% and 0%, respectively. The risk assessment result obtained with the hazard quotient (HQ) method shows that the HQ of the four pesticides was far less than one, indicating that the risk is considered acceptable for the four pesticides in Pu'er tea. The largest HQ was found for tolfenpyrad, 0.0135, and the smallest was found for indoxacarb, 0.000757, but more attention should be paid to tolfenpyrad in daily diets in the future, because its detection rate, and residual and residual median were all relatively high.",

        "abstract": "Green tea has many health benefits and is the most consumed type in China. However, the heavy metals and contaminants in tea can also pose a great risk to human health. In this study, mercury (Hg) concentration in green tea collected from 11 provinces in China was examined. The leaching characteristics of Hg during brewing and the associated exposure to drinkers were also evaluated. Results indicated a low potential of Hg accumulation in green tea. The Hg content of green tea from Wanshan District, Guizhou Province-which has the largest Hg mine in China and is severely contaminated by Hg-could be limited by controlling the harvest time of tea leaves. The average Hg content of green tea from 43 tea production sites in China was only 6.3 ± 6.4 µg/kg dry weight. The brewing experiments of green tea showed that the leaching ratio of Hg was 22.61 ± 7.58% for 40 min of a single brew, and increased to 32.83 ± 12.37% after four rounds (3 min/ round) of brewing. The leaching of Hg from tea leaves was significantly affected by leaching time, temperature, and solid-liquid ratio but not by water hardness. The risk of Hg exposure from green tea intake was found to be very low, with an average hazard quotient (HQ) value of only 1.82 ± 1.85% for a single brew in 40 min and 2.64 ± 2.68% after four rounds of brewing. However, in some highly contaminated areas, with HQ values as high as 43.12 ± 2.41%, green tea intake may still pose a high risk of Hg exposure, and this risk should not be ignored.",

        "abstract": "The origin of 9, 10-anthraquinone (AQ) contamination in tea remains unclear at present. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that AQ could be produced from the precursor anthracene in tea plantations. To test this hypothesis, the uptake, translocation, and transformation of anthracene in tea (Camellia sinensis) seedlings using hydroponic experimentation was investigated. Anthracene concentrations in tea tissues rose with increased anthracene exposure, which in the roots were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those in aboveground parts at the end of the exposure. These results indicated that anthracene tended to be adsorbed into tea seedling via the roots and accumulated largely within roots. The three main pathways of anthracene degradation in tea seedlings were suggested: oxygen was incorporated in the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> positions of anthracene resulting in AQ (I) and anthrone (II), and naphthalene was formed by ring fission of anthracene via methylanthracene (III). The principal anthracene metabolites were AQ and anthrone. The concentrations of AQ, like anthrone, were markedly elevated in the roots than those in stems throughout the entire exposure period. Moreover, the translocation factors for anthracene and its primary metabolites AQ and anthrone from roots to stems were persistently lower than 0.1, demonstrating a poor translocation from roots to the aboveground regions. However, tea seedlings could take anthracene up from water and translocate it to the leaves. It was a possible risk for AQ contamination in tea leaves continuously exposed to anthracene for long periods of time because tea plants were perennial crops.",

A probabilistic approach was performed to evaluate the dietary exposure of perchlorate for six different subpopulations. The daily intakes (EDIs) for consumers over the age of 41 were higher than that of other subpopulations. The hazard quotient for six groups was lower than 1 even at the extreme percentile (P99).

        "abstract": "Tea plants that have a large leaf area mainly suffer from heavy metal accumulation in the above-ground parts through foliar uptake. With the world rapid industrialization, this pollution in tea is considered a crucial challenge due to its potential health risks. The present study proposes an innovative approach based on visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics for the characterization of tea chemical indicators under airborne lead stress, which can be performed fast and in situ. The effects of lead stress on chemical indicators and accumulation in leaves of the two tea varieties at different time intervals and levels of treatment were investigated. In addition, changes in cell structure and leaf stomata were monitored during foliar uptake of aerosol particles by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The spectral variation was able to classify the tea samples into the Pb treatment groups through the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model. Two machine learning techniques, namely, partial least squares (PLS) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), were evaluated and compared for building the quantitative determination models. The RBFNN models combined with correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and PLS data compression methods were used to optimize the prediction performance. The results demonstrated that the PLS-RBFNN as a non-linear model outperformed the PLS model and provided the R-value of 0.944, 0.952, 0.881, 0.937, and 0.930 for prediction of MDA, starch, sucrose, fructose, glucose, respectively. It can be concluded that the proposed approach has strong application potential in monitoring the quality and safety of plants under airborne heavy metal stress.",

The PU/PMMA composite was evidenced to possess rapid adsorption and strong accumulation towards neonicotinoids compared with the films used alone. A series of parameters were optimized, and the agitation mode, film size, ionic strength, desorption solvent and sample pH were found to dominate the microextraction process rather than the extraction temperature, agitation time and sample volume. The thin films are cost effective and efficient for single use analysis, but still can be reused at least 8 times with no significant loss in performance. The ten neonicotinoids were measured with good recoveries (81.1-107.9%), high enrichment factors (up to 135), low limits of detection (0.001-0.1 µg L<sup>-1</sup>), and wide linearity range (1-500 µg L<sup>-1</sup>, r<sup>2</sup>>0.9981) in fruit juice (apple, lemon, and pomegranate) and tea (green tea and black tea) samples. The proposed method was successfully applied to commercial fruit and tea drinks, and no samples were tested positive on target neonicotinoids.

Three cups of fermented tea consumed per day decreased risks of CHD and diabetes by 8.16% and 12.77% respectively.

        "abstract": "The collaborative assessment and health risk evaluation of heavy metals (HMs) enrichment in soils and tea leaves are crucial to guarantee consumer safety. However, in high soil HM geochemical background areas superimposed by human activities, the health risk associated with HMs in soil-tea systems is not clear. This study assessed the HMs concentration (i.e., chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb)) in tea leaves and their relationship with soil amounts in the southwest region of China to evaluate the associated health risk in adults. The results revealed that the average soil concentration of Cr was the highest (79.06 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), followed by Pb (29.27 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), As (14.87 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and Cd (0.18 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). Approximately 0.71, 4.99, 7.36, and 10.21% of soil samples exceeded the threshold values (NY/T 853-2004) for Pb, Cr, As, and Cd, respectively. Furthermore, the average concentration of Pb, As, and Cd in tea leaves was below the corresponding residue limits, but Cr was above the allowed limits. Correlation analysis revealed that the Pb, Cr, As, and Cd amounts in tea leaves were positively correlated to their soil amounts (<i>p</i> < 0.01) with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.203 **, 0.074 **, 0.036 **, and 0.090 **, respectively. Additionally, approximately 40.38% of the samples were found to be contaminated. Furthermore, spatial distribution statistical analysis revealed that Lancang was moderately contaminated, while Yingjiang, Zhenkang, Yongde, Zhenyuan, Lüchun, Jingdong, Ximeng, and Menglian were slightly contaminated areas. The target hazard quotients (THQ; health risk assessment) of Pb, Cr, As, and Cd and the hazard index (<i>HI</i>) of all the counties were below unity, suggesting unlikely health risks from tea consumption.",

        "abstract": "To explore the spatial heterogeneity of pH and cadmium (Cd) content in the soils of the tea gardens in the plateau mountain regions as well as its driving factors, the pH values, Cd content and other physical and chemical indicators from 423 soil samples were examined. A coefficient of variation method and a semivariance function model was adopted to explore the soils' spatial heterogeneity, and a random forest approach was applied to evaluate the factors influencing environmental Cd under different pH values. The results show that the pH values of the soils of the tea gardens in the plateau mountain regions were within the appropriate range for the growth of tea plants, and soil samples with pH values falling between 4.5 and 6.0 account for 74% of all samples. A comparison against the criteria of risk screening values for the contamination of agricultural land, a component of quantifying soil environmental quality in China, was preformed; it was determined that the content of heavy metal Cd in the soil of the tea gardens did not exceed the limit. The content of soil pH in the research area gradually declined from southwest to northeast, exhibiting two distinct parallel distribution zones running along the southwest-northeast direction. The spatial distribution of the heavy metal Cd content in the soil showed a gradually decreasing trend from north to south, with low-value polygons dominantly appearing in the southeasternmost area and high-value polygons concentrated in the north. When the soil pH ≤ 5.5, it had the largest effect on the Cd content; when 5.5 < pH ≤ 6.5, the physical indicators in soil had a relatively larger impact on the Cd content.",

        "abstract": "The problem of excessive lead content in tea has become more and more serious with the development of society and industry. This paper investigated the ability of visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to evaluate foliar lead uptake by tea plants through simulating real air pollution. Lead content of tea leaves in different treatment groups during stress time was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). It was determined that stomata can be a channel for lead particles in the air and most of the lead entering through the stomata accumulates in the leaves. The spectral variation of treated samples was measured, and it was found that a combination of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and spectral responses can perfectly classify the tea samples under different lead concentrations stress with an overall accuracy of 0.979. Then the Vis-NIR spectra were used for fast monitoring physiological and biochemical indicators in tea leaves under atmospheric deposition. Relevant spectra pretreatment methods and characteristic wavelength selection approaches were evaluated for quantitative analysis and then optimal prediction models to instantly detect quality indicators in tea samples were built. Among predictive models, PLS had the best results (RMSE = 0.139 mg/g, 0.663 mmol/g, and 1.494 μmol/g) for the prediction of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), ascorbic acid (ASA), and glutathione (GSH), respectively. Also, principal component regression (PCR) gave the best results (RMSE = 0.053 mg/g, 0.024 mg/g, and 0.011%) for prediction of chlorophyll b (Chl-b), carotenoid (Car) and moisture content (MC), respectively. Results of this study can be applied for developing an effective and reliable approach for monitoring atmospheric deposition in plants.",

In this study, the carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health risk for trace elements in tea influenced by the country of origin, tea type, and infusion process was assessed. Tea (Camellia sinensis) purchased from China, India, and the USA, including black and green tea, were analyzed for essential micronutrients (Cu, Se, and Zn) and nonessential trace elements (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, and Pb) in leaves and three types of infusions. The results showed that country of origin, tea type, and infusion process had a significant influence on the trace element contents in tea leaves and infusions, also on health risk. Country of origin had a significant influence on Ba, Cr, Pb, and Zn contents in tea leaves and on As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn contents in tea infusions. Black tea had significantly higher (p < 0.05) Cr and Cu content in tea leaves than green tea, but only Cr content was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of green tea in tea infusion. The trace element contents were the highest in the first infusion and decreased as the number of infusion steps increased. The results showed that the consumption of tea infusion was not likely to cause noncarcinogenic risk. However, the carcinogenic risk for As was of concern. Our results indicate that avoiding drinking the first infusion can help to reduce both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health risks for trace elements.",

However, tea can be contaminated by different pesticides particularly those outdated pesticides which have been familiar as one of the main difficulties in Ethiopia and contaminate the food commodities. From a study done in south west of Ethiopia, Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and endosulfan were detected in commonly consumed food items. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to analyze the residue of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in tea collected from the market and assessing their risks to consumers. 19 different tea samples were randomly collected from supermarkets in Jimma town and Addis Ababa city. In the analytical procedure, QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Rugged, and Safe) method was applied for the extraction of tea samples. The finding of the study revealed that, five OCPs (aldrin, γ-chlordane, DDT, endrin, and dibutylchlorepoxide) were detected at a concentration of 0.1465, 0.167, 0.2044, 0.3067 and 0.4089 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in domestic tea, respectively, while endosulfan sulfate, methoxychlor, and heptachlor epoxide were detected at a concentration of 0.258, 0.458 and 1.427 mg kg-1 in imported tea samples respectively. From the pesticides detected, the mean concentration of DDT (0.292-0.825 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) is above the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) established by China (0.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of γ-chlordane and endrin were above the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), this indicates that there is a health risk for tea consumers. The detection of pesticide residues in tea reveals that there is the widespread use of OCPs in the study area for agricultural purposes or as vector control. Therefore, strict regulation of pesticides during production, importing, sale, and application in the field is important for Ethiopia.",

Based on 2 years of surveillance, the long-term and cumulative chronic exposure risks of pesticide residues through white tea drinking were assessed for different subpopulations in Fujian, China. Twenty-five different pesticides were found, and 74.8% of samples contained at least one pesticide residue. The most frequently detected pesticide was bifenthrin with detection rates of 61.6%. Risk assessment was performed using both the deterministic approach and semiprobabilistic model under the best-case and the worst-case scenarios. The results demonstrated that the dietary risks were extremely low for six different subpopulations in which the risks for adults over the age of 41 were relatively higher. The risk ranking scheme indicated that isocarbophos and triazophos were considered to be of medium risk. The different use suggestions for the 25 positive pesticides are proposed to further minimize the exposure risk to consumer health.

        "abstract": "In this study, a novel sorbent, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate functionalised magnetic poly β-cyclodextrin, was successfully synthesised and applied to magnetic solid-phase extraction for the determination of pyrethroids in tea infusions. The sorbent was characterised by transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurement. All factors affecting extraction efficiency, such as sorbent amount, extraction time, ionic strength and desorption conditions, were optimised individually. Under the chosen conditions, wide linearity (2.5-500 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) with determination coefficients ranging from 0.9995 to 0.9999, low limits of detection of 0.32-0.54 μg L<sup>-1</sup> and good precision (intra-day: 2.6-7.0%; inter-day: 3.5-7.6%) were achieved for four pyrethroids in tea infusions. The relative recoveries of target analytes in real tea infusion samples were from 70% to 101% with relative standard deviations lower than 9.1%. We conclude that the proposed method is promising in the detection of pyrethroids in tea infusions.",

The matrix effect of our proposed method was between -27.3 and 27.7%, which was lower than that in other methods, indicating that this method effectively reduced the interference of tea matrix in the mass spectrometry process. This method was used to determine the levels of PMG, GLU, and AMPA in 780 samples, including six traditional Chinese teas (green tea, black tea, oolong tea, dark tea, white tea, and yellow tea) and a floral tea, from 14 provinces of China. Probability estimates showed that the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile risk entropy values of the three pesticide residues were far below the acceptable risk level.

The cleanup effect of the column was evaluated based on the rates of removal of tea components that interfered with pesticide recovery, henceforth referred to as interference components.

        "abstract": "A total of 80 rooibos tea samples from a range of brands were purchased from various registered retail shops in South Africa. The samples were bought during 2019 winter (40) and summer (40) period which are classified as 6 natural rooibos, 18 herbal rooibos samples, and 16 flavor rooibos samples and subjected for heavy metal analysis such as chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Human health risks were determined by estimating the daily intake non-cancer hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) via oral exposure to toxic elements based on daily tea consumption. The concentration range of the determined heavy metals in rooibos tea samples were as follows: Cr (0.17-11.98 mg/kg), Fe (31-450 mg/kg), As (ND-0.51 mg/kg), Cd (0.09-0.17 mg/kg), and Pb (0.06-2.73 mg/kg). Cr was found in higher amount when compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) permissive limit (1.3 mg/kg). The concentrations of all studied heavy metals during winter and summer period were compared using two-way Anova, and no significant differences (p = 0.832) were observed for the two seasons. Both the target risk quotient (THQ) and the hazard index (HI) levels in all analyzed tea were well below 1, implying that intake of rooibos tea with analyzed heavy metals should not cause a threat to human health. On the other hand, the continuous intake due to the high concentrations of trace metals such as Cr may pose a serious chronic health risk due to accumulation in body tissues over time. The study, therefore, suggests constant monitoring of these heavy metals in teas in order to limit the risk of exceeding the permissive limits.",

In this study, we collected 225 paired soil and tea plant samples from 45 tea gardens in 15 provinces of China to survey the current risk of potentially toxic element accumulation in Chinese tea gardens. The results suggest that the average contents of most trace metals in rhizosphere soils meet the risk control standard for agricultural land in China. However, the mean contents of As, Cr, Cd, Zn, Cu, and Ni in rhizosphere soils were 1.94, 2.14, 1.23, 1.15, 1.18, and 1.19 times their corresponding background soil values in China. Cd had the highest geo-accumulation index, followed by As, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, and Mn in rhizosphere soils. Nearly 2.22% and 4.44% of soils were moderately to heavily contaminated with As and Cd, respectively. The risk index ranged from 18.0 to 292, with an average value of 90.0, indicating low to moderate ecological risk in Chinese tea gardens. This is the first national-scale reconnaissance of trace metals in tea across China.

Analytes were detected by HPLC-MS/MS. The main factors affecting transfer rate proved to be mycotoxins' polarity, pH of the resulting infusion (for OTA, FB2, and MPA) and matrix-infusion contact period. The concentration of mycotoxins increased by 20-50% within the first ten minutes of infusing, after that kinetic curve changed slowly. The concentration of DON and FB2 increased by about 10%, for ZEA, MPA, and STC it stayed constant, while for T-2, TE, AOH, and AFLs G1 and G2 it went down. Maximum transfer correlated well with analytes polarity. Maximum transfer of ENNs, BEA, STC, ZEA, and AOH into infusion was below 25%; AFLs-25-45%; DON, TE, and T-2 toxins 60-90%, FB1-80-100%.

Moreover, a probabilistic risk assessment (noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks) was estimated by models including target hazard quotient (THQ) and cancer risk (CR). The samples were subjected to microwave mineralisation with the use of HNO<sub>3</sub> (65%), while the determination of the content of the elements was performed with the use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and a mercury analyser. The element which was characterised by the highest level of accumulation in the analysed samples was lead (from 0.010 to 5.680 mg/kg). Among the heavy metals under analysis, the lowest concentration was noted in the case of mercury (from 0.005 to 0.030 mg/kg). A notably higher level of contamination with heavy metals was noted in the analysed samples of herbs and spices (0.005-5.680 mg/kg), compared to samples of tea and coffee (0.005-0.791 mg/kg). According to the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO) concerning the limits of contamination of samples of herbal raw materials with heavy metals, lead levels exceeding the limits were only noted in 24 samples of herbs (18%). In all of the analysed samples of spices, tea, and coffee, no instances of exceeded limits were noted for any of the analysed heavy metals.

Polycyclic quinones were produced at a low water activity, within a wide pH range, and in the presence of air. 9,10-Anthraquinone formation had an activation energy of 46.1 ± 0.1 kJ·mol<sup>-1</sup>, and a reaction pathway for the formation of the different naphthoquinones and anthraquinones is proposed. These reactions also took place in tea, therefore suggesting that the common tea pollutant 9,10-anthraquinone is also a process-induced contaminant. In fact, when four commercial teas (from a total of eight studied teas) were heated at 60 °C for 72 h, they significantly (p < 0.05) increased the amount of this toxicant.

This fact has led to the increasing analysis of exogenous compounds including priority POPs such as polychlorinated dibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as well as highly persistent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Currently, plasticizer residues are also considered an emerging issue because of the extensive use in food packaging and potential migration into foodstuffs. In this review, the studies published from 2010 to 2020 were discussed, including the main extraction methods applied for these contaminants from herbs, spices, and tea, and it was revealed the trend toward the use of less solvent-consuming and time-effective methods. Chromatographic methods were also described, which were mainly combined with detection techniques such as classical or mass spectrometry (MS) detection. Finally, a comprehensive overview of the occurrence of these selected exogenous compounds was presented in the studied matrices, showing that their monitoring should be further investigated to ensure food safety of highly consumed condiments and tea.",

Despite the different varieties, particular emphasis has been placed on green tea (GT), considering the associated health benefits following its regular consumption, some of which are due to its polyphenol constituents, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Tea is not prone to the growth of microorganisms, except fungus, when proper storage, handling, and packing conditions are compromised. Consequently, mycotoxins, secondary metabolites of fungi, could contaminate tea samples, affecting human health. In the present study, we aimed to assess the balance between risks (due to mycotoxins and high levels of EGCG) and benefits (due to moderate intake of EGCG) associated with the consumption of GT. For this, 20 GT samples (10 in bulk and 10 in bags) available in different markets in Lisbon were analyzed through a LC-MS/MS method, evaluating 38 different mycotoxins. Six samples revealed detectable values of the considered toxins. Current levels of mycotoxins and EGCG intake were not associated with health concerns. Scenarios considering an increasing consumption of GT in Portugal showed that drinking up to seven cups of GT per day should maximize the associated health benefits. The present study contributes to the future establishment of GT consumption recommendations in Portugal.",

        "abstract": "Helium is commonly used as a carrier gas in gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS); however, there are growing concerns regarding its global shortage and the resulting limited supply and high cost. Using nitrogen as an alternative carrier gas in GC-MS/MS with the widely used electron ionisation (EI) technique leads to a significantly lower sensitivity; thus, in this study, we explored the use of atmospheric-pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) as the ionisation method and examined the applicability of GC-(APCI)MS/MS with nitrogen gas for the determination of pesticide residues. GC-(APCI)MS/MS using nitrogen provided slightly wider peaks, and poorer isomeric separation compared to those using helium under identical conditions; however, the peak intensities were comparable. GC-(APCI)MS/MS using nitrogen was validated for 166 pesticides in green tea at a spiking level of 0.01 mg/kg and was compared with the conventional GC-(EI)MS/MS using helium gas. Except dimethomorph and resmethrin, GC-(APCI)MS/MS showed satisfactory results that were comparable to those of GC-(EI)MS/MS for most compounds, with trueness in the range of 73%-95% and relative standard deviations of <11%. The sensitivity and selectivity of GC-(APCI)MS/MS with nitrogen were superior to those of GC-(EI)MS/MS with helium. Therefore, GC-(APCI)MS/MS using nitrogen as the carrier gas, which has minimal concerns related to availability, could be a promising alternative to the conventional GC-(EI)MS/MS technique that employs helium.",

Pesticide extraction and analysis were performed by using a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method and gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) and the limits of quantification (LOQ) of pesticides were ranged 0.1-7.26 and 0.8-24 μg/kg for dried tea leaves and 0.03-3.1 and 0.09-10 μg/L for the tea infusion, respectively. The levels of pesticide residue in 52 (86.67%) out of 60 tea samples were above the LOD (0.1-7.26 μg/kg). Twenty four (40%) of the samples contained pesticides in a concentration higher than the maximum residue limit (MRL) set by the European Commission (EC). Seven out of 33 validated pesticides were detected in dried tea leaf samples that only four of seven, including buprofezin, chlorpyrifos, hexaconazole, and triflumizole, were transferred into tea infusion, demonstrating that the concentrations of pesticides in infusion were raised during brewing. The risk assessment study for detected pesticides in the tea infusion samples indicated that this beverage consumption was safe for consumers, while the mean residue of some pesticides in positive samples was higher than the MRL; therefore, periodic control of these pesticides should be regularly implemented.",

Herein, the degradation of GA<sub>3</sub> and its conversion into main metabolites were investigated during tea planting, manufacturing, and brewing using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The metabolite iso-GA<sub>3</sub> was first discovered during the tea production chain and identified using Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry. GA<sub>3</sub> dissipated following first-order kinetics in tea shoots with half-lives ranging from 2.46 to 2.74 days. It was degraded into iso-GA<sub>3</sub> in tea shoots, which had a longer residual period than GA<sub>3</sub>. Meanwhile, external application of GA<sub>3</sub> could increase the proportion of growth-promoting endogenous phytohormones and lead to rapid growth of tea plants. During tea manufacturing, iso-GA<sub>3</sub> was quickly and massively converted from GA<sub>3</sub>. Fixing (heat at 220-230 °C) played an important role in the dissipation of GA<sub>3</sub> and iso-GA<sub>3</sub> during green tea manufacturing, but there were high residues of iso-GA<sub>3</sub> in black tea. High transfer rates (77.3 to 94.5%) of GA<sub>3</sub> and iso-GA<sub>3</sub> were observed during tea brewing. These results could provide a practical reference for food safety in tea and other agricultural products and the guidance for scientific application of GA<sub>3</sub> in tea planting.",

The key feature of the aptamer probe is the synergistic utilization of the dual-wavelength fluorescent signal outputs from a G-quadruplex specific dye and a DNA intercalation dye under a single-wavelength excitation, leading to a more stable and reliable recognition of Pb<sup>2+</sup> than that of analyses based on single fluorescent reporter.

Third, based on the augmented SERS spectra, the 1D CNN models were established on the cloud server, and then the trained 1D CNN models were used for subsequent pesticide residue identification analysis. In addition, to investigate the identification performance of the 1D CNN method, four conventional identification methods, including partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were also developed on the basis of the augmented SERS spectra and applied for pesticide residue identification analysis. The comparative studies show that the 1D CNN method possesses better identification accuracy, stability and sensitivity than the other four conventional identification methods.

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the residues of 42 pesticides subject to public concern in Tieguanyin tea produced in Fujian, China. The presence of 42 pesticide residues in 90 Tieguanyin tea samples were determined. A total of 17 pesticides were detected. At least one pesticide residue was detected in 65 samples (72.2%). The detected pesticides imidacloprid, tolfenpyrad, bifenthrin, acetamiprid were found in 55.6%, 33.3%, 18.9% and 16.7% of samples, respectively. Pesticide residues in Tieguanyin tea varied significantly over the seasons and across the production regions. Based on data obtained, the health risks associated with long-term exposure to those pesticides were assessed and risks of detected pesticides were ranked. The hazard quotients (HQs) among the detected pesticides range from 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> for fenpropathrin to 3 × 10<sup>-4</sup> for imidacloprid. The results demonstrated that despite a high occurrence of pesticide residues in Tieguanyin tea, residue levels observed could not be considered as a serious public health problem. The risk ranking scheme showed dicofol and thiacloprid were considered to pose a medium-risk. The suggestions for 17 detected pesticides used in Tieguanyin tea plantation were made, including those already banned from use in China (dicofol and methomyl), recommended for diminished use (thiacloprid and chlorpyrifos), and permitted use with considering the pre-harvest interval (13 other pesticides).",

The aim of this study was to assess the bioburden (bacteria and fungi) of bulk and bags of GT marketed in Lisbon and to obtain a more refined fungal burden characterization, including azole resistance profile. The bacteriota in tea bags before boiling ranged from lower than the detection limit to 1770 CFU.g<sup>-1</sup>, whereas in brew samples ranged from lower than the detection limit to 54.55 CFU.mL<sup>-1</sup>.

Aspergillus sections Fumigati and Nidulantes were detected by using real time PCR, but not in the GT samples in which they were identified through culture-based methods. A significantly reduction of bacterial contamination after boiling was observed, however fungal contamination with toxigenic potential was observed before and after boiling. Future research work needs to characterize in detail the mycotoxins contamination to allow a risk-benefit assessment to estimate the human health benefits and risks following tea consumption and to support policy-actions, if and when needed. The results also suggest that the conditions how tea is packed can influence the fungal diversity and this variable should be further investigated.",

Different chemometric algorithms were applied on the acquired SERS and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) chemical reference data to select effective wavelengths and spectral variables in order to develop models to predict the Hg<sup>2+</sup>.

It is important to know the Pb exposure level in tea and the risk assessment for local residents who drink brick tea daily. This study detected sixteen brick tea samples over 26 years and fifteen green tea samples in 2011 in a southeast city of Hubei province. The Pb content in brick tea was found to increase rapidly with the fast development of industrial activities represented by car sales from 1985 to 2011, which was less susceptible to gasoline. The concentrations of Pb in 16 brick tea were in the range of 1.77-17.8 mg/kg with a mean value of 11.1 mg/kg. Their percentiles P<sub>50</sub>, P<sub>90</sub>, and P<sub>95</sub> were 13.22, 16.95, and 17.21 mg/kg. A regressional model was built, suggesting strong correlation between the Pb content in brick tea and the car sales. The concentrations of Pb in 15 green tea samples were between 0.36-1.30 mg/kg with a mean value of 0.66 mg/kg and the percentiles P<sub>50</sub>, P<sub>90</sub>, and P<sub>95</sub> were 0.62, 1.05, and 1.23 mg/kg. The MOE values of brick tea and green tea were all greater than 1 just considering tea consumption which displayed low Pb exposure risk. By adding the Pb exposure by food, the MOE values for green tea were still greater than 1 while the MOE values of brick tea were less than 1 suggesting a potential risk of Pb exposure to the people drinking brick tea daily, who should pay more attention.",

In this study, three surveys were conducted to obtain the overall profiles of NEO residue levels (seven NEOs and one metabolite) in Chinese tea over a period of seven years. A total of 726 tea samples were tested, and nearly 87% of the samples were found to have detectable NEO residues. The overall average detection frequency of acetamiprid was the highest, reaching 73%. Imidacloprid residues in 4.6% of the samples exceeded the Chinese maximum residue limits, whereas clothianidin and nitenpyram had been detected in Chinese tea samples since 2014. The applications of thiacloprid and thiamethoxam gradually increased, and some tea samples with high residue levels appeared in China. These findings signal the replacement of new and old varieties of NEOs in China. Both long- and short-term cumulative exposures to NEOs were calculated based on optimistic and pessimistic models recommended in the EFSA guidelines. In the three survey periods, the average total imidacloprid-equivalent concentrations were 484.63, 1713.36, and 1148.34 μg/kg, respectively.

There is a growing interest in using rooibos tea as a supplement for the deficiency of metallic nutrients in South Africa.

Experimental conditions were optimized by studying the effect of pH and various organized media on the fluorescence signal of OTA. For each analysed matrix (coffee grains and tea leaves), several sample pretreatments and calibration methods (external or standard addition) and data processing by chemometric models (e.g., parallel factor analysis/PARAFAC and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares/MCR-ALS) were evaluated and discussed. The MCR-ALS algorithm provided an adequate fit to the data for both samples, while PARAFAC was satisfactory only for the tea samples. Regarding the figures of merit, the limits of detection were in the range of 0.2-0.3 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>; furthermore, low relative prediction errors, between 2% and 4%, were achieved in both the fortified and real samples. Accordingly, the proposed methodology was applied to analyse fortified roasted and green coffee and real tea leaf samples. Satisfactory recoveries were achieved (ranging from 92 to 110%), and the obtained concentrations were in agreement with the values obtained by the reference method (based on high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection/HPLC-FLD). In addition, all samples contained OTA levels lower than the maximum permissible levels. Finally, the proposed strategy allows the use of green analytical chemistry principles; for instance, the use of organic solvents and the generation of waste products were significantly lower than for similar analytical methods reported in the literature.",

In the processing process of both black tea and green tea, the chlorfenapyr residue decreased by 59.1-67.6% compared with the residue in tea shoots due to high vapor pressure (1.2 × 10<sup>-2</sup> mPa 25 °C), and drying was the key step that dissipated the chlorfenapyr. A low leaching efficiency of 2.2-3.4% from tea leaves to tea infusion, resulted in low water solubility (0.14 mg L<sup>-1</sup> 25 °C), indicated that >90% of the residual chlorfenapyr was eliminated before the intake of tea infusion. On the basis of these results, an extremely large proportion of the chlorfenapyr deposited on tea shoots was degraded during tea planting, tea processing, and tea brewing, and the health risk was reduced primarily in the first and the last step rather than during tea processing. The remaining 0.2% chlorfenapyr sprayed on the tea shoots represents a negligible health risk based on the RQ assessment. The pesticides with high vapor pressure and low water solubility were more recommended in tea garden for pest control.",

Levels of 9,10-anthraquinone were determined at each step of the manufacturing process for green and black tea using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For green tea, anthraquinone was present beginning at the withering process and increased in concentration until the first drying step. Additionally, for black tea, the first drying step resulted in a significant increase in anthraquinone content, whereas the concentration decreased during the final drying step. For black tea, anthraquinone was also detected during withering, although the concentration continued to increase throughout the entire procedure, particularly during drying.

In this study, highly sensitive, efficient, and rugged analytical methods were adapted for simultaneous determination of 400 pesticide residues in green tea products using ultra performance liquid and gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS). Matrix effects were minimized by combining QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) extraction and mixed-mode SPE clean-up with different sorbents in sample preparation. A C18 SPE cartridge paired with SPE GCB/PSA proved to be the most effective clean-up method and enabled 225 pesticide residues to be quantified, based on solvent calibration curves (154 residues using UPLC-MS/MS and 71 residues using GC-MS/MS). The analytical methods were validated fully in accordance with the SANTE/11945/2015. LOQs for most pesticides (386/400 or 96.5%) were below 10 µg/kg, i.e., less than the EU MRL (5-70 mg/kg).

However, microplastics knowledge for many beverage products excluding beers is still lacking. Here, common beverages (n = 57; 27 brands) such as soft drinks (n = 19), energy drinks (n = 8), cold tea (n = 4) and beer (n = 26) were targeted for microplastics occurrences in Mexico and their shape, size, surface morphology and polymer composition were analyzed. Microplastics were detected in 48 out of 57 samples tested. The results identified microplastics of various forms (fibers and fragments) and sizes (0.1-3 mm) of colors (blue, red, brown, black and green), in amounts ranging from not detected to 28 ± 5.29 particles/L. Micro-Raman spectroscopy identified particles as polyamide, poly(ester-amide), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and poly(ethylene-terephthalate) indicating microplastics contamination of synthetic textiles and packaging origin in the beverage products. Finally, this paper discusses that human excreta could act as a vehicle for the dispersion and accumulation of microplastics into terrestrial and aquatic environments.

However, the effects of geological difference on distribution of heavy metals in soils and their accumulation in tea leaves remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate the impacts of geological difference on distribution of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), thallium (Tl), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and manganese (Mn) in soils and their accumulation in tea leaves, and further evaluate their health risks. 22 soils and corresponding young tea leaves (YTL) and old tea leaves (OTL), from geologically different plantations, were sampled and analyzed. Results showed that heavy metals concentrations in soils, derived from Permian limestone and Cambrian weakly mineralized dolomite, were obviously greater than those from Silurian clastic rock. The geological difference controlled the distribution of soil heavy metals to a large extent. Contents of Cd, Tl, and Mn in tea leaves mainly depended on their contents in soils. Soil Hg, Pb, As, and Sb contents may not be the only influencing factors for their respective accumulation in tea leaves. More attentions should be paid to soil acidification of tea plantations to ensure the tea quality security. Target hazard quotients (THQ) of Cd, Pb, Tl, Hg, As, Sb, Cr, and Ni and hazard index (HI) via tea intake were below one, indicating no human health risk. The non-mineralized Silurian area was less at risk of heavy metals accumulation in tea leaves than the Cambrian metallogenic belt and the Permian Cd-enriched zone. This study could provide an important basis to understand and mitigate the potential risks of heavy metals in tea.",

        "abstract": "In this study, gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source was applied for the quantitative analysis of pesticide residues in tea. To determine the optimum ionization conditions for multiresidue analysis, the full-scan mass spectra and peak intensities of pesticides were compared in the presence and absence of water as a modifier. When water was added as a modifier in the ion source, most of the target compounds formed [M+H]<sup>+</sup> ions and exhibited enhanced intensities. However, compounds consisting of only carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine, such as aldrin, γ-hexachlorocyclohexane, and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, typically formed M<sup>+·</sup> or fragment ions, whose intensities were significantly decreased by the addition of water. GC-MS/MS methods using APCI (without modifier addition) and electron ionization (EI) were validated for 16 pesticides in tea at spiking levels of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg. Unlike EI, signal suppression was observed for most compounds at a spiking level of 0.01 mg/kg using APCI; however, dilution of the samples minimized this effect. Using APCI, the trueness of the target compounds ranged from 77% to 121% at both spiking levels, except for pyrethrins owing to matrix effects, with relative standard deviations of less than 14%. For most compounds, these results were comparable with those obtained using EI. However, because the use of APCI limited fragmentation, this ionization technique offered significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than EI. Using APCI, linear calibration curves with coefficients of determination greater than 0.998 were obtained in the range of 0.0005-0.5 μg/mL for all compounds. These findings indicated that GC-MS/MS with APCI is applicable for the routine monitoring of pesticide residues, even in complex samples such as tea.",

        "abstract": "Chinese dark tea is widely enjoyed for its multiple health-promoting effects and pleasant taste. However, its production involves fermentation by microbiota in raw tea, some of which are filamentous fungi and thus potential mycotoxin producers. Accordingly, whether mycotoxins pose health risk on dark tea consumption has become a public concern. In this study, a cleaning method of multi-functional column (MFC) and immunoaffinity column (IAC) in tandem combined to HPLC detection was developed and validated for determining ten mycotoxins of six groups (i.e., aflatoxins of B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins of B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, and T-2) in dark teas. The interferences from secondary metabolites were effectively reduced, and the sensitivities and recoveries of the method were qualified for tea matrices. Six groups mycotoxins were determined in 108 samples representing the major Chinese dark teas by using the new method. Subsequently, the dietary exposure and health risks were evaluated for different age and gender groups in Kunming and Pu'er in China and Ulan Bator in Mongolia. The occurrence of zearalenone was 4.63% and that of ochratoxin A was 1.85%, with the other four groups mycotoxins were below the limits of quantification. The hazard index values for the five groups' non-carcinogenic mycotoxins were far below 1.0. The deterministic risk assessment indicated no non-carcinogenic risks for dark tea consumption in the three areas. Probabilistic estimation showed that the maximum value of 95th percentile carcinogenic risk value for the aflatoxins was 2.12 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, which is far below the acceptable carcinogenic risk level (10<sup>-6</sup>). Hereby, six groups mycotoxins in Chinese dark tea showed no observed risk concern to consumers.",

Cartap decreased rapidly with time, and it was degraded into nereistoxin and cartap monothiol during tea production chain. Cartap monothiol residues dissipated rapidly by 98% in three days during tea planting. Nereistoxin had a longer residual period than cartap and it dominated the total residue in made tea after tea manufacturing.

Many studies on the alleviation of heavy metal toxicity by exogenous phytohormones have emerged, but reports on tea (Camellia sinensis) are still scarce. In this study, the effects of indole acetic acid (IAA) (2 μM and 10 μM) on Cd uptake and on the physiological and biochemical characteristics of the 'Xiangfeicui' tea cultivar were investigated for the first time. The order of Cd accumulation in tea seedlings was root > stem > mature leaf > tender leaf. Under Cd stress (30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), photosynthetic pigment levels, antioxidant enzyme activity, root vigor, root IAA content, and the levels of most metabolites (including caffeine, soluble sugar, total amino acids, some amino acid components, and most catechins) were significantly reduced, while levels of malondialdehyde, proline, epicatechin, and some amino acids increased.

        "abstract": "Multiple pesticide residues are frequently present in tea leaves and while the majority of residues satisfy Taiwan's current health regulations, there are potential health effects from pesticide exposure that are of great concern for tea drinkers. We undertook a systematic probabilistic risk assessment of 59 pesticides in tea leaves from 1629 tea leaf samples obtained by Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration in two monitoring surveys in 2015. Bayesian statistics used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate posterior distributions of pesticide residues in tea leaves, lifetime average daily doses and hazard quotients (HQs) of evaluated pesticides. We classified 95th percentile values of HQs into three categories: 0 < HQ < 0.5, 0.5 ≤ HQ ≤ 1 and 1 < HQ. The 95th percentiles of HQs for triazophos (3.39), carbofuran (2.04) and endosulfan (1.80) exceeded 1 in the adult population; the HQ for 3-OH carbofuran was 0.97 and was less than 0.5 for the remaining 55 pesticides. The health risk posed by pesticide residues for tea drinkers is negligible, if triazophos, carbofuran, endosulfan, and 3-OH carbofuran residues satisfy regulatory standards. However, five legacy pesticides, DDT, methomyl, carbofuran, dicofol and endosulfan, were identified. To reduce uncertainties, this study combined Bayesian statistics with a mode of action approach for systematic risk assessment of co-exposure to multiple pesticide residues in tea leaf samples. Measuring pesticide transfer rates will improve the quality of future risk assessments concerning residues in tea leaves. Appropriate management of pesticides in Taiwanese tea farms and monitoring of pesticide residues in imported tea is warranted to protect Taiwan's tea drinkers.",

A sizeable influence of parent material for leaves was also observed, suggesting that Pb may be present in the dust-fall. Although Sr concentrations in leaves were not high, they exceeded that in soils. The high BCF also indicated that tea has a high capacity to accumulate Sr, with the coincidence that Sr<sup>87</sup>/Sr<sup>86</sup> in the acid-extractable isotope in soils were similar to new leaves.

The extraction parameters (extraction time, ionic strength, desorption conditions) were optimized. The adsorption mechanism was evaluated utilizing Fourier transform infrared spectra. Under optimum conditions, satisfactory analytical performances were achieved, which included high precision (1.33-9.62%), low limits of detection (0.19-3.54 µg/L), and wide linear range (2.5-500 µg/L) for the analysis of the acaricides. Moreover, the proposed method proved highly effective for the determination of acaricides in tea samples, with the relative recoveries in the range of 65.20-108.13% and relative standard deviations < 9.87%.

The extractant was intentionally dispersed into the sample solution in the form of globules through high-speed agitation. This procedure increases the contact area between the binary phases and shortens the distribution equilibrium time. The fine globules reassembled by decelerating stirring speed, the extractant could be taken out for gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Recovery studies were performed under optimized extraction conditions by using matrix blanks fortified with pesticides at three concentrations (10, 50, and 100 µg/kg). Over 87% of the recoveries for the analytes in four tea matrices were acceptable given their recovery ranges of 70-120% and relative standard deviations of ≤20%. The limits of quantification of most pesticides were lower than 10 µg/kg and thus satisfied the requirements for maximum residue levels prescribed by the European Community. A total of 38 tea samples from local markets were analyzed by using the proposed method. Results showed that chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide in teas.

In this work, SERS technology was used to detect chlorpyrifos residues in tea products at the semiquantitative level. A simple pretreatment method effectively avoided interference of other fluorescent substances, and all major peaks could be distinguished on the basis of a novel substrate. A principal component analysis algorithm was applied to form a regression model, and a nanogram detection limit was obtained.

We show that steeping a single plastic teabag at brewing temperature (95 °C) releases approximately 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 billion nanoplastics into a single cup of the beverage. The composition of the released particles is matched to the original teabags (nylon and polyethylene terephthalate) using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The levels of nylon and polyethylene terephthalate particles released from the teabag packaging are several orders of magnitude higher than plastic loads previously reported in other foods. An initial acute invertebrate toxicity assessment shows that exposure to only the particles released from the teabags caused dose-dependent behavioral and developmental effects.",

        "abstract": "A homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction performed in narrow tube coupled to in-syringe-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on deep eutectic solvent has been developed for the extraction of six herbicides from tea samples. In this method, sodium chloride as a separation agent is filled into the narrow tube and the tea sample is placed on top of the salt. Then a mixture of deionized water and deep eutectic solvent (water miscible) is passed through the tube. In this procedure, the deep eutectic solvent is realized as tiny droplets in contact with salt. By passing the droplets from the tea layer placed on the salt layer, the analytes are extracted into them. After collecting the solvent as separated layer, it is mixed with another deep eutectic solvent (choline chloride/butyric acid) and the mixture is dispersed into deionized water placed in a syringe. After adding acetonitrile to break up the cloudy state, the collected organic phase is injected into gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Under optimal conditions, limits of detection and quantification in the ranges of 2.6-8.4 and 9.7-29 ng/kg, respectively, were obtained. The extraction recoveries and enrichment factors in the ranges of 70-89% and 350-445 were obtained, respectively.",

An analytical method is thus urgently needed to investigate the residue level and source of phthalimide in tea.

        "abstract": "Penconazole is a typical triazole fungicide with wide use on fruits, vegetables, and tea plants to control powdery mildew. In the present study, an efficient graphite carbon black solid phase extraction (GCB-SPE) purification combined with chiral ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for determination of penconazole enantiomers in different complex matrices, including grape, tea, soil, lotus root, lotus leaf, lotus seed and hulls. The method was then applied to investigate the enantioselective dissipation of penconazole enantiomers in a real field experiment of grape and soil. As a result, a satisfactory separation of penconazole enantiomers on a chiral Lux Cellulose-2 column (150 mm × 2 mm i.d., 3 µm) was obtained with 0.1% formic acid in methanol and 10 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> ammonium acetate in water (75/25, v/v) as mobile phase at 0.25 mL min<sup>-1</sup>. The enantiomer (+)-penconazole was firstly eluted, and (-)-penconazole was then eluted. The method showed reliable performances in linearity, recovery and precision, the recoveries of (+)-penconazole and (-)-penconazole in all of six matrices were between 70.5% and 121.0% with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranging from 0.8% to 23.6% at the low, medium and high spiked levels. The limits of quantitation (LOQs) of this method were lower than 0.0025 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in grape, soil and lotus root, 0.005 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in lotus leaf, lotus seed meat and lotus seed shell, and 0.0125 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in tea. Results of field trials indicated that (-)-penconazole degraded faster than its (+)-isomer in grape. While only a moderate stereoselectivity was observed in soil, with (-)-penconazole preferential degraded. The proposed method could be used to investigate enantioselective environmental behavior of penconazole enantiomers in complex matrices. And results in this study could provide useful information on realistic risk assessment of penconazole in grape.",

However, the safety of these products needs to be assessed, for example monitoring the potential presence of contaminants such as pesticides. In this paper, we report an analytical method for determining three neonicotinoid insecticides - thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid - that are widely used worldwide. This method is based on quenching by analytes of the luminescence signal of terbium ions. Terbium presents a time-resolved luminescence signal at 256/545 nm/nm, which is quenched by the presence of low concentrations of the selected analytes. Detection limits of 0.1, 0.2 or 0.75 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> were obtained for thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and imidacloprid, respectively. Recovery experiments in different teas (green tea, black tea, chamomile, peppermint) were performed at concentrations lower than the maximum residue limits established by the European Union and the Codex Alimentarius for tea samples. In all cases, satisfactory recovery yields were observed, and the results were compared with a chromatographic reference method. The proposed method therefore proved suitable for quantifying these insecticides, fulfilling the current legislation.",

        "abstract": "Tea tree (Camellia sinensis) is a valuable and popular cash crop widely planted in tropical and subtropical areas of China. To increase tea yield and quality, high rates of chemical fertilizer and pesticide application have generally been used; however, increasing usage of fertilizers and pesticides does not always proportionally increase tea yield. Indeed, excessive nutrient inputs may cause serious agricultural non-point source pollution. A pilot study on dual reduction in fertilizers and pesticides was conducted in a green tea plantation in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, to explore the environmental effects of different fertilizer and pesticide managements (e.g., changes in soil properties and nutrient accumulation, nutrient inputs in runoff water) and to reveal the potential effects of the interaction of these two managements on tea yield and quality. Traditional formulas and rates of chemical fertilizers and pesticides were used as the baselines (100% usage); replacement with different proportions of organic fertilizer (i.e., 20%, 50% and 80%) and direct pesticide reductions of 30%, 50%, and 80% were tested. The results showed that proper management with organic fertilizer replacement can effectively mitigate soil acidification and nutrient deficiency in tea plantations, increase soil organic matter (OM) and ammonium nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) contents, and promote tea yield and quality. Moreover, managements with organic fertilizer replacement can markedly reduce the inputs of ammonium nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO<sub>3</sub>-N), total phosphorus (TP), and total potassium (TK) in runoff water. Soil nutrient accumulation was the highest while the runoff nutrient input was the lowest at 20% organic fertilizer replacement. Experimental spraying of bifenthrin and chlorfenapyr revealed that these pesticides were mainly trapped by the tea leaves and rarely entered the soil or water bodies. Although pesticide reduction treatments can effectively decrease pesticide residues in tea leaves, differences in pesticide residue between various treatments were not obvious due to the rapid degradation of pesticides. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that 50% of the variation in tea yield, bud density, polyphenols, and caffeine can be explained by interactions between fertilizers and pesticides. Combinations of 20% or 50% organic fertilizer replacement and 30% or 50% pesticide application reduction are appropriate for both mitigating nutrient loss and balancing tea yield and quality, especially the combination of 50% organic fertilizer replacement and 50% pesticide reduction, which produced the best results. This study demonstrates the feasibility of dual reductions in fertilizers and pesticides for mitigating environmental hazards while maintaining the yield and quality of tea.",

The results showed that the quality of water used for steeping tea has a direct effect on the leaching concentrations of metals in the tea infusion and this effect can be reduced by using pure water or commercially available drinking water. Further, the two tea-soaking methods used by local residents can reduce the metal intake. The health risk assessment determined that the carcinogenic risk values of Cr, As, and Pb (Cr > Pb > As) were within an acceptable range (10<sup>-7</sup>-10<sup>-4</sup>); therefore, the concentrations of these metals in tea infusions do not pose substantial carcinogenic risk to tea drinkers.

        "abstract": "Tea is one of the most popular beverages all over the world. Being an everyday drink for almost everyone, for centuries tea was considered safe and healthy. However, fungal contamination of tea at any stage of commodity production can pose a serious health hazard due to the accumulation of toxic secondary metabolites of moulds. Contemporary research revealed incidences of highly contaminated samples. Mycotoxin transfer from naturally contaminated raw tea into beverage was well studied for ochratoxin A only, and the possible leak of other mycotoxins is discussed. The results of several surveys were combined to evaluate aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A contamination levels in black tea and Pu-erh. Exposure estimate to aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A due to tea consumption was carried out based on these data. Average contamination level corresponds to the exposure of 3⁻40% (aflatoxin B1) and 5⁻24% (ochratoxin A) of mean overall estimates for different cluster diets. Lack of data does not allow the conclusion for the necessity of public health protection measures. It is necessary to perform representative studies of different kinds of tea for regulated mycotoxins at least. Contemporary techniques for analysis of mycotoxins in tea are summarised in the present review.",

        "abstract": "Rinsing dried tea leaves before brewing is a traditional way of preparing rolled oolong tea in China. This study analyzes how rinsing green, black, and oolong tea before brewing affects the levels of pesticide residues in the tea infusion. Eight representative insecticides of different polarities were tracked, namely, three neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam), two organophosphates (dimethoate and malathion), and three pyrethroids (bifenthrin, β-cypermethrin, and fenvalerate). The results showed that the eight pesticides transferred into the rinse water at rates between 0.2 and 24% after 5, 10, 20, or 30 s. Rinsing tea before brewing reduced the pesticide risk levels by 5-59% in the tea infusion. Five functional components, such as epigallocatechin gallate and caffeine, were reduced by 0-11% in the tea infusion. The results can be used to develop an effective method of rinsing tea before brewing that reduces pesticide exposure risks.",

        "abstract": "Food and beverage consumption is an important route for human exposure to metals. Traditional tea (Camellia sinensis) is a widely-consumed beverage, which may contain toxic metals. This study determined total and infusion concentrations of 5 metals including Al, As, Cd, Cr, and Pb in 47 traditional and herbal teas from 13 countries and assessed their potential risks to human health. The data showed that herbal teas exhibited higher As (0.26mgkg<sup>-1</sup>), Cd (0.19mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) and Pb (2.32mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) than traditional teas. Black tea from India had high Cr at 31mgkg<sup>-1</sup> while white tea from China had low Cr at 0.39mgkg<sup>-1</sup>. Arsenic, Cd and Pb did not exceed the WHO limit for medicinal plants excluding one herbal tea with 1.1mgkg<sup>-1</sup> As and 26.4mgkg<sup>-1</sup> Pb. However, Cr in 47% herbal teas and 73% traditional teas exceeded the Canada limit of 2mgkg<sup>-1</sup>. Metal concentrations in tea infusions were below the MCL for drinking water except for Al. Total Al and its infusion was lower in herbal teas (47-1745mgkg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.09-3.95mgL<sup>-1</sup>) than traditional teas (50.3-2517mgkg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.02-7.51mgL<sup>-1</sup>), with 0.9-22% and 4-49% of the Al being soluble in infusion. The Al concentrations in infusion in all black tea and 83, 75 and 25% of the green, oolong and herbal teas exceeded the secondary MCL for drinking water at 0.2mgL<sup>-1</sup>. However, the weekly intake of Al from drinking tea (0.001-0.39 and 0.003-0.56mgkg<sup>-1</sup> for children and adults) was lower than the provisional tolerable weekly intake for Al at 1.0mgkg<sup>-1</sup>.

During any one season, there were differences in Al, Mn, and Cd levels between tea varieties. Seasonally, autumn tea and/or summer tea had far higher levels of Al, Mn, Pb, and Cd than did spring tea. Tea leaf maturity positively correlated with the concentrations of Al, Mn, Pb, and Cd, but negatively with Cu. The calculated average daily intake doses (mg/ [kg•d]) for these metal elements were 0.14 (Al), 0.11 (Mn), 2.70 × 10<sup>-3</sup> (Cu), 2.80 × 10<sup>-4</sup> (Pb), and 2.88 × 10<sup>-6</sup> (Cd).

The extracted metal was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The parameters that affect the extraction of cadmium were optimized using the univariate method. Under optimized conditions, the method presented a limit of detection of 0.17 μg/L, a limit of quantification of 0.57 μg/L, an enrichment factor of 56, and a consumptive index of 0.18 mL/min. The accuracy of the method was tested by analyzing the certified reference material, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 1573 (tomato leaves). The determination of Cd in water (drinking water, bottled water, river water, and seawater) and tea (black and green tea) samples was also performed using the proposed method.

Increased Cd accumulation potential was observed in the tea plant in a Cd-enriched environment, but most of the Cd was absorbed by the roots of C. sinensis. The Cd in all the root fractions was mostly distributed in the soluble fraction, followed by the cell wall fraction. By contrast, the Cd was least distributed in the organelle fraction. The adsorption of Cd onto the C. sinensis roots was described well by the Langmuir isotherm model than the Freundlich isotherm. Most of the Cd (38.6 to 59.4%) was integrated with pectates and proteins in the roots and leaves. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that small molecular organic substances, such as amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates with N-H, C=O, C-N, and O-H functional groups in the roots, bonded with Cd(II). The Cd accumulation in the C. sinensis leaves occurred in the cell wall and organelle fractions. C. sinensis has great capability to transport Cd, thereby indicating pollution risk. The metal homeostasis of Fe, Mn, Ca, and Mg in C. sinensis was affected when the Cd concentration was 1.0-15.0 mg/L.",

The average concentrations of Al, Mn, Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn in the soil were 106 × 10³, 214, 20.9, 0.09, 0.12, 17.5, 121, 27.8, 131.2, and 64 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The heavy metals' pollution indexes in the soil can be ranked as follows: Cu > Cr > Hg > As > Ni > Zn > Pb > Mn > Cd. The soil was moderately polluted by Cu because of the high geochemical background value of Cu in the area. The potential environment risk index (RI) showed that 7.69% out of the total sample sites were within the moderate level. Moreover, the ranges of Al, Mn, Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn concentrations in young tea leaves were 250-660, 194-1130, 0.107-0.400, 0.012-0.092, 0.014-0.085, 0.073-0.456, 0.33-1.26, 6.33-14.90, 14.90-26.10, and 35.8-50.3 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

Besides, the accumulation ability of tea leaves to Mn was the strongest, and the average bioconcentration factor (BCF) of Mn in mature tea leaves was 12.5. In addition, the average target hazard quotients (THQ) were all less than one for the young tea leaves and the average aggregate risk hazard index (HI) to adults was 0.272, indicating that there was not a potential health risk for adults through the consumption of the infusions brewed by young tea leaves.

The graphene oxides (GO) reduction as well as amino grafting were achieved simultaneously in one step via a facile solvothermal synthetic strategy. The obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to confirm the modification of GO with different amino groups. The adsorption performance of catechins and caffeine from tea acetonitrile extracts on different amine functional rGO samples were evaluated. It was found that tributylamine-functional rGO (tri-BuA-rGO) exhibited the highest adsorption ability for catechins and caffeine compared to GO and other amino group functional rGO samples. It was worth to note that the adsorption capacity of catechins on tri-BuA-rGO was 11 times higher than that of GO (203.7mgg<sup>-1</sup> vs 18.7mgg<sup>-1</sup>). Electrostatic interaction, π-π interaction and surface hydrophilic-hydrophobic properties of tri-BuA-rGO played important roles in the adsorption of catechins as well as caffeine. The gravimetric analysis confirmed that the tri-BuA-rGO achieved the highest efficient cleanup preformance compared with traditional dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) adsorbents like primary-secondary amine (PSA), graphitized carbon black (GCB) or C18. A multi-pesticides analysis method based on tri-BuA-rGO is validated on 33 representative pesticides in tea using gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The analysis method gave a high coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>>0.99) for each pesticide and satisfactory recoveries in a range of 72.1-120.5%.

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to develop a multimycotoxin liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method with a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure (DLLME) for the analysis of AFs, 3aDON, 15aDON, NIV, HT-2, T-2, ZEA, OTA, ENNs, and BEA in tea beverages and to evaluate their mycotoxin contents. The proposed method was characterized in terms of linearity, limits of detection (LODs), limits of quantification (LOQs), recoveries, repeatability (intraday precision), reproducibility (interday precision), and matrix effects to check suitability. The results show LODs in the range of 0.05-10 μg/L, LOQs in the range of 0.2-33 μg/L, and recoveries in the range of 65-127% (RSD < 20%). The method developed in this study was applied to 44 commercial samples of black tea, red tea, green tea, and green mint tea. The results show that, of the analyzed mycotoxins, AFB2, AFG2, 15aDON, AFG1, and ENB were detected in the samples. AFB2 (14.4-32.2 μg/L) and 15aDON (60.5-61 μg/L) presented the highest levels. Green mint tea contained the highest concentration of mycotoxins. The risk assessment study shows that the population is not much exposed to mycotoxins through the consumption of tea beverages.",

However, neonicotinoid residues released from tea leaves into tea infusions pose a dietary risk to consumers. Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and reliable on-site detection method for neonicotinoids is needed. We developed a quantum-dot-based fluorescent lateral flow immunochromatographic strip (LFICS) combined with a broad-specific antibody for detection of typical neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, imidaclothiz, and clothianidin), with sensitivities [50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>)] of 0.104-0.33 ng/mL and visual detection limits of 0.5-1 ng/mL. The strip assay could be completed in less than 30 min. Using the LFICS to analyze spiked tea samples (green tea, black tea, and oolong tea), the average recovery of the three neonicotinoids ranged between 71 and 111%, with the coefficient of variation below 12%. The results from the LFICS tests for field samples were consistent with results from ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

To this end, levels of 28 PAHs in black, green, red and white teas available on the Polish retail market have been assessed. Profiles and correlation between concentrations of individual PAHs have been identified. A model study on transfer of PAHs from tea leaves into tea preparations has been conducted. Relatively high concentrations of 28 evaluated PAHs have been found in 58 tested samples of black, green, red and white teas sampled on the Polish retail market. Total concentration ∑28PAH ranged from 57 to 696 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> with mean 258 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> (dry tea leaves). The most mature tea leaves fermented to a small degree contained relatively the highest PAH levels among all four tested tea types. Relatively low PAH transfer rates into tea infusions and limited volumes of the consumed tea keep the risks associated with PAH dietary intake at a safely low level.

The possible contamination pathway and main factors to decrease AQ were explored in tea cultivation- tea manufacture- tea infusion, on the basis of AQ analytical methods by using solvent extraction and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) quantification. 58.8-84.6% of AQ degraded in tea processing, and drying played a key role to reduce the AQ contamination. Certain concentration of AQ deposited on tea shoots could resulted in AQ beyond the MRL of 0.02mg/kg in tea. AQ leaching into tea brew (about 10%) could lead to the possible health risk.

        "abstract": "A new fluorimetric method with rhodamine-based fluorescent agent was developed for the rapid speciation of Cr(III)/Cr(VI) in tea, soil and water samples. The system, which utilizes a fluorescent reagent, was used for the first time after synthesis/characterization of 3',6'-bis(diethylamino)-2-{[(1E)-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methylene] amino}spiro[isoindole-1,9'-xanthen]-3(2H)-one (BDAS). The reagent responds instantaneously at room temperature in a 1:1 stoichiometric manner to the amount of Cr(III). The selectivity of this system for Cr(III) over other metal ions is remarkably high, and its sensitivity is below 0.01mgL<sup>-1</sup> in aqueous solutions which enables a simplification without any pretreatment of the real sample. The method has a wide linear range of 0.1-10mgL<sup>-1</sup> and a detection limit of 0.15μgL<sup>-1</sup> for Cr(III) while the relative standard deviation was 0.1% for 0.1mgL<sup>-1</sup> Cr(III) concentration. The results of detection and recovery experiments for Cr(III) in tea, soil and water were satisfactory, indicating that the method has better feasibility and application potential in the routine determination and speciation of Cr(III)/Cr(VI).

In this study, a multi-residue analytical method for the determination of pyrethroids (fenpropathrin, beta-cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and fenvalerate) in honeysuckle, chrysanthemum, wolfberry, and licorice and their infusion samples was validated. The transfer of pyrethroid residues from tea to infusion was investigated at different water temperatures, tea/water ratios, and infusion intervals/times. The results show that low amounts (0-6.70%) of pyrethroids were transferred under the different tea brewing conditions examined, indicating that the infusion process reduced the pyrethroid content in the extracted liquid by over 90%. Similar results were obtained for the different tea varieties, and pesticides with high water solubility and low octanol-water partition coefficients (log K<sub>ow</sub>) exhibited high transfer rates. Moreover, the estimated values of the exposure risk to the pyrethroids were in the range of 0.0022-0.33, indicating that the daily intake of the four pyrethroid residues from herbal tea can be regarded as safe.

Although the F from teas posed no immediate health hazards with hazard quotient <1, some tea samples could potentially contribute >4 mg F/d, thereby adding to the overall F burden.

The limit of quantification of analytical method was 0.05µg/g and the average recoveries were ranged from 88.36% to 103.49% with relative standard deviations of less than 6% at three spiked levels. The experimental results showed that in the green tea leaves imidacloprid dissipated faster than beta-cyfluthrin with the half-life ranging between 1.20-1.39 and 2.89-3.15days, respectively. The beta-cyfluthrin residues present in the processed tea not transferred into the tea infusion during the infusion process and imidacloprid transferred in the range 43.12-49.7%.

PAH residues in tea leaves increased by 2.4-3.1 times during the manufacture of green tea using the electric heating model. After correction to dry weight, PAH residue concentrations decreased by 33.5-48.4% during green tea processing because of PAH evaporation. Moreover, spreading and drying reduced PAH concentrations. The transfer rates of PAH residues from green tea to infusion varied from 4.6% to 7.2%, and PAH leaching was higher in the first infusion than in the second infusion.

S.3A/3) growing soil influenced by lower to higher doses of inorganic and organic amendments. While ecological risk indices were applied, it was observed that same treatment showed different risk levels but contamination risk status did not vary significantly. All the indices showed significant correlation with heavy metals' concentration in young shoots of tea plants. As the indices characterized experimental soils with different extents of contamination, it would be important to standardize the indices with long term experiments followed by generation of new index. Therefore, we formulated a new contamination index named as Tea Research Association Heavy Metal Contamination Index (TRAHMCI) for tea growing soils. TRAHMCI is based on the probable change of metal status in soil with progress of growth of tea plant. This could be useful to negate discrepancies arised from use of various existing metal contamination indices in tea growing soils amended with different doses of fertilizers. TRAHMCI was formulated based on individual contamination factor using statistical technique and applied to the present dataset which provided a more holistic understanding of overall tea growing soil behavior. The limitation of the developed TRAHMCI index is that, the index had not been validated for other crops in our study not to claim its effective use for crops other than tea. As already mentioned, this new index had been formulated by taking tea as the test crop with above mentioned six heavy metal contents in young shoot and made tea.",

The optimum SBE conditions were found to be as follows: extraction temperature 45 °C, extraction time 30 min, number of extraction cycles 1, and in such a condition that the extraction efficiency reached as high as 92%. Further, the catechins, theanine, caffeine and aroma components, which determine the quality of the tea, fluctuated after SBE treatment. Compared with the uncrushed leaves, pesticide residues can more easily be removed from crushed leaves, and the practical extraction efficiency was 97%.

        "abstract": "The current study aims to assess the infusion pattern of three important micronutrients namely copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) contents from black tea samples produced in Assam (India) and Thohoyandou (South Africa). Average daily intakes and hazardous quotient were reported for these micronutrients. Total content for Cu, Fe, and Zn varied from 2.25 to 48.82 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, 14.75 to 148.18 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, and 28.48 to 106.68 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The average contents of each of the three micronutrients were higher in tea leaves samples collected from South Africa than those from India while the contents in tea infusions in Indian samples were higher than in South African tea samples. Results of this study revealed that the consumption of 600 mL tea infusion produced from 24 g of made tea per day may be beneficial to human in terms of these micronutrients content. Application of nonparametric tests revealed that most of the data sets do not satisfy the normality assumptions. Hence, the use of both parametric and nonparametric statistical analysis that subsequently revealed significant differences in elemental contents among Indian and South African tea.",

We characterized fungal and bacterial communities in leaves and both Pu-erhs by high-throughput, rDNA-amplicon sequencing and we characterized the profile of bioactive extrolite mycotoxins in Pu-erh teas by quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 390 fungal and 629 bacterial OTUs from leaves and both Pu-erhs. Major findings are: 1) fungal diversity drops and bacterial diversity rises due to raw or ripened fermentation, 2) fungal and bacterial community composition changes significantly between fresh leaves and both raw and ripened Pu-erh, 3) aging causes significant changes in the microbial community of raw, but not ripened, Pu-erh, and, 4) ripened and well-aged raw Pu-erh have similar microbial communities that are distinct from those of young, raw Ph-erh tea. Twenty-five toxic metabolites, mainly of fungal origin, were detected, with patulin and asperglaucide dominating and at levels supporting the Chinese custom of discarding the first preparation of Pu-erh and using the wet tea to then brew a pot for consumption.",

Therefore, an attempt was made to establish a database on the important heavy metals: cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb). For an initial survey on heavy metals, soil samples were collected randomly from tea-growing areas of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, India. Parallel studies were conducted in the greenhouse on uptake of Pb, Cd, and Ni from soils supplemented with these metals at different concentrations. Finally, metal distribution in the tea plants under field conditions was also documented to assess the accumulation potential and critical limit of uptake by plants.",

Concentrations of heavy metals and minerals in tea from 15 different brands in Kumasi, Ghana were measured to assess the health risk associated with their consumption. The mineral and metal contents (Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, As, Cd) were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Z-8100 polarized Zeeman). The results revealed that the mean concentrations were in the order: Ca > Fe > As > Cd > Zn > Pb. The average contents of Ca, Fe, Zn, Pb, Cd, and As in the samples were 94.08, 6.15, 0.20, 0.16, 0.36, and 1.66 mg/kg, respectively. All the minerals and heavy metals were below the maximum permissible limits stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Pharmacopeia (USP). Metal-to-metal correlation indicated strong correlations between As/Zn, Cd/Zn, Cd/As, and Pb/As pairs. Factor analysis demonstrated a clear separation between minerals, grouped on one side, and heavy metals, clustered on another side. Both the target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) levels in green tea were far below 1, suggesting that consumption of green tea should pose no potential risk to human health. However, carcinogenic risk levels for arsenic were high; R > 10(-6). The results showed that residents in Kumasi consume tea could be at risk from exposure to these heavy metals and minerals.",

To research the degradation trends and establish regression equations, determination days were plotted as horizontal ordinates and the residue concentrations of pesticide were plotted as vertical ordinates. Here, we consider the degradation equations of 271 pesticides over 40 and 120 days, summarize the degradation rates in six aspects (A-F), and discuss the degradation trends of the 271 pesticides in aged Oolong tea in detail. The results indicate that >70% of the determined pesticides coincide with the degradation regularity of trends A, B, and E, i.e., the concentration of pesticide will decrease within 4 months. Next, 20 representative pesticides were selected for further study at higher spray concentrations, named c and d (d > c > b > a), in aged Oolong tea over another 90 days. The determination days were plotted on the x-axis, and the differences between each determined result and first-time-determined value of target pesticides were plotted on the y-axis. The logarithmic function was obtained by fitting the 90-day determination results, allowing the degradation value of a target pesticide on a specific day to be calculated. These logarithmic functions at d concentration were applied to predict the residue concentrations of pesticides at c concentration. Results revealed that 70% of the 20 pesticides had the lower deviation ratios of predicted and measured results.",

The main nutritional benefits of drinking tea are its anti-oxidant properties, presumed protection against certain cancers, inhibition of inflammation and possible protective effects against diabetes. Laser induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) was assembled as a powerful tool for qualitative and quantitative analysis of various brands of tea samples using 266 nm pulsed UV laser. LIBS spectra for six brands of tea samples in the wavelength range of 200-900 nm was recorded and all elements present in our tea samples were identified. The major toxic elements detected in several brands of tea samples were bromine, chromium and minerals like iron, calcium, potassium and silicon. The spectral assignment was conducted prior to the determination of concentration of each element. For quantitative analysis, calibration curves were drawn for each element using standard samples prepared in known concentration in the tea matrix. The plasma parameters (electron temperature and electron density) were also determined prior to the tea samples spectroscopic analysis. The concentration of iron, chromium, potassium, bromine, copper, silicon and calcium detected in all tea samples was between 378-656, 96-124, 1421-6785, 99-1476, 17-36, 2-11 and 92-130 mg L(-1) respectively.

To further confirm the accuracy of our LIBS results, we determined the concentration of each element present in tea samples by using standard analytical technique like ICP-MS.

Data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a pan-Canadian pregnancy cohort, were used. All participants with a gestational age of ⩾20 weeks (n=1954) with available biomarkers were included. Geometric means (GMs) for lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium and manganese in maternal (first and third trimesters) and cord blood, as well as speciated arsenic in maternal urine in the first trimester, were calculated for participants who drank regular, green or herbal tea and for those who did not. Differences between groups were examined using chi-square tests. Adjusted least squares geometric means (LSGMs) were estimated by tea intake, controlling for factors such as country of birth, coffee intake and maternal smoking. Concentrations of all metals were above the limits of detection in most participants in the first trimester: lead (GM): 0.62 μg/dl), mercury (GM: 2.99 nmol/l); cadmium (GM 1.93 nmol/l), arsenic (GM 9.75 nmol/l) and manganese (GM 160.1 nmol/l).

Those who consumed herbal tea in the third trimester had significantly higher third trimester maternal and cord blood lead concentrations than non-herbal tea drinkers.

        "abstract": "Health Canada's Radiation Protection Bureau has identified trace quantities of (134)Cs and (137)Cs in commercially available green tea products of Japanese origin. Referenced to March 11, 2011, the activity ratio ((134)Cs/(137)Cs) has been determined to be 1:1, which supports an origin from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. The upper limits of typical tea beverage preparation conditions were applied to the most contaminated of these green tea samples to determine the proportion of radiocesium contamination that would be available for human consumption. The distribution of radiocesium among the components of the extraction experiments (water, residual tea solid, and filter media) was determined by both conventional and Compton-suppressed gamma spectroscopy. The latter aided tremendously in providing a more complete radiocesium distribution profile, particularly for the shorter-lived (134)Cs. Cesium extraction efficiencies of 64 ± 7% and 64 ± 5% were determined based on (134)Cs and (137)Cs, respectively. Annual, effective dose estimates from ingestion of (137)Cs and (134)Cs (1.8-3.7 μSv), arising from the consumption of tea beverages prepared from the most contaminated of these samples, are insignificant relative to both total (∼ 2.4 mSv) and ingested (∼ 0.28 mSv) annual effective doses received from naturally occurring radioactive sources. As such, there is no health concern arising from the consumption of green tea beverages contaminated with radiocesium at the levels encountered in this study.",

Because tea plants are perennial crops, there is the fear that the contamination might last for a long time. The objectives of this study were to reveal time series changes in the distribution of radiocaesium in tea plants after radioactive fallout and to evaluate the effect of pruning on reduction of radiocaesium concentrations in new shoots growing next year. The experimental tea field was located in Shizuoka, Japan, approximately 400 km away from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant in a southwest direction. Time series changes in radiocaesium concentrations in unrefined tea, a tea product primarily produced for making Japanese green tea, from May 2011 to June 2013 and distribution of radiocaesium in tea plants from May 2011 to May 2012 were monitored. The radiocaesium concentrations in unrefined tea exponentially decreased; the effective half-lives for (134)Cs and (137)Cs were 0.30 and 0.36 y during the first 2 y after the accident, respectively. With time, the highest concentrations of (137)Cs moved from the upper to the lower parts of plants. Medium pruning 2-3 months after the accident reduced the concentration of (137)Cs in new shoots harvested in the first crop season of the following year by 56% compared with unpruned tea plants; thus, pruning is an effective measure for reducing radiocaesium concentration in tea.",

The method combines the advantages of dynamic microwave-assisted extraction and single-drop microextraction, which could greatly simplify the operation and reduce the whole pretreatment time. In the developed method, tea samples were extracted with 25% ethanol aqueous solution and purified with acidic alumina at the same time, and then the analytes were concentrated into microextraction solvent. When the extraction was completed, the solvent microdrop containing the enriched analytes was retracted into the microsyringe and directly analyzed by GC-MS without any filtration or cleanup step. The method makes extraction, cleanup, separation, and enrichment to be carried out in one step. Several experimental parameters, including type of extraction solvent, type and amount of dispersant, type and volume of microextraction solvent, microwave power, extraction time, and flow rate of extraction solvent were investigated and optimized. Under optimal experimental conditions, good linearity was observed in the range of 2.00-500.00 μg kg(-1).

        "abstract": "Heavy metals and Al in tea products are of increasing concern. In this study, contents of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb in commercially available green tea and its infusions were measured by ICP-MS and ICP-AES. Both target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) were employed to assess the potential health risk of studied metals in tea leaves and infusions to drinkers. Results showed that the average contents of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb in tea leaves were 487.57, 0.055, 0.29, 1.63, 17.04, 7.71, and 0.92 mg/kg, respectively. Except for Cu, metal contents were within their maximum limits (1, 5, 30, and 5 mg/kg for Cd, Cr, Cu, and Pb, respectively) of current standards for tea products. Concentrations of metals in tea infusions were all below their maximum limits (0.2, 0.005, 0.05, 1.0, 0.02, and 0.01 mg/L for Al, Cd, Cr(VI), Cu, Ni, and Pb, respectively) for drinking water, and decreased with the increase of infusion times. Pb, Cd, Cu, and Al mainly remained in tea leaves. The THQ from 2.33 × 10(-5) to 1.47 × 10(-1) and HI from1.41 × 10(-2) to 3.45 × 10(-1) values in tea infusions were all less than 1, suggesting that consumption of tea infusions would not cause significant health risks for consumers. More attention should be paid to monitor Co content in green tea. Both THQ and HI values decreased with the increase of infusion times. Results of this study suggest that tea drinkers should discard the first tea infusion and drink the following infusions.",

        "abstract": "Empoasca vitis (Göthe) is an important insect pest in tea-growing areas of China, and chemical control is the main tactic for the management of this pest. Due to the pressure of increasing insecticide resistance and more stringent food safety regulations, development of sound IPM strategies for E. vitis is an urgent matter. This study comparatively evaluated four field populations of E. vitis from three different tea-growing regions in China for their susceptibilities to eight insecticides using a simple leaf-dip methodology. E. vitis was found to be most sensitive to indoxacarb (LC50<0.5 mg/liter) and least sensitive to isoprocarb (LC50>5 mg/liter) and sophocarpidine (LC50>95 mg/liter, a botanical pesticide) regardless of populations. Population (geographical) variations were higher for indoxacarb and imidacloprid than other compounds. Judging by the 95% fiducial limits of LC50 values, all populations had similar susceptibilities to chlorfenapyr, bifenthrin, and acetamiprid or imidacloprid. Correlation analysis suggested that chlorfenapyr and indoxacarb or isoprocarb may have a high risk of cross resistance. Considering potency (LC50) and maximum residual levels, chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin are good insecticide options followed by acetamiprid and indoxacarb. These results provide valuable information to intelligently select insecticides for IPM programs that are efficacious against E. vitis while also managing insecticide resistance and maximum residual levels for tea production in China.",

        "abstract": "A new analytical method was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of 423 pesticides, isomers, and pesticide metabolites in nutraceutical products obtained from green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize a generic extraction method. The automated extraction procedure was achieved in a simple disposable pipet extraction. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the separation and detection of all the analytes. The method was validated by taking into consideration the guidelines specified in European SANCO/12571/2013 Guideline 2013 and Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The extraction recoveries were in a range of 81.6-113.0%, with coefficient of variation <6.4%. The limits of decision for the analytes are in the range 0.04-4.15μgkg(-1). The detection capabilities for the analytes are in the range 0.07-6.92μgkg(-1). The 423 compounds behave dynamic in the range 0.1-200μgkg(-1) concentration, with correlation coefficient >0.99. This validated method has been successfully applied on screening of pesticide residues in one hundred and twenty-four different commercial nutraceutical products from green tea extract, and methamidophos, resmethrin, propoxur, tridemorph, ethiofencarb, flamprop isopropyl, furalaxyl, bifenthrin and fenpropathrin were detected in a few samples tested in this study.",

Certification of GLHK-11-03 was based on an analytical method purposely developed for the accurate measurement of the mass fraction of the target analytes in the material. An isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method involving determination by (i) gas chromatography-negative chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (GC-NCI-MS) and (ii) gas chromatography-electron ionization-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-EI-HRMS) techniques was employed.

The bagged teas contained higher amounts of Pb, Mn, Fe, Ni, Al, and Cr compared with leaf teas of the same brand, whereas the infusions of bagged tea contained higher levels of Mn, Ni, Al, and Cr compared with leaf tea infusions. Generally, the most abundant trace metals in both types of tea were Al and Mn. There was a wide variation in percentage transfer of elements from the dry tea materials to the infusions.

Most people drink tea as an infusion (adding hot water); however, in some countries, including India, China and Egypt, tea is drunk as a decoction (tea and water are boiled together). An infusion usually brings the soluble ingredients into solution, whereas a decoction brings all soluble and non-soluble constituents together. Therefore, a cup of tea may contain various kinds of contaminants. This review focuses on green and black tea because they are most commonly consumed. The target was to examine the transfer rate of contaminants - pesticides, environmental pollutants, mycotoxins, microorganisms, toxic heavy metals, radioactive isotopes (radionuclides) and plant growth regulators - from tea to infusion/brewing, factors contributing to the transfer potential and contaminants degradation, and residues in or on the spent leaves. It is concluded that most contaminants leaching into tea infusion are not detected or are detected at a level lower than the regulatory limits. However, the traditional practice of over-boiling tea leaves should be discouraged as there may be a chance for more transfer of contaminants from the tea to the brew.",

        "abstract": "Determining the residues of dinotefuran and its metabolites (MNG, UF, and DN) is highly problematic because of their polar characteristics. Additionally, tea contains many compounds that can interfere with residue analysis. Thus, the aim of the present study was to refine the extraction method that assures good recoveries for dinotefuran and its metabolites and removes most of the matrix components in green tea using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). We attempted to increase the extraction efficiency of the QuEChERS method by selecting the appropriate solvents among ethyl acetate, acetone, isopropanol, 25% methanol in acetonitrile, and methanol. We found that methanol was the best extraction solvent for dinotefuran and its polar metabolites in dry green tea samples; however, due to a limitation of an appropriate partitioning salt, acetonitrile was used as the extraction solvent. Matrix enhancement and suppression effects were observed for all analytes, which made the recovery rates variable. DN recovery was <70% when compared with matrix-matched calibration, whereas it was within the acceptable range (70-120%) when compared with solvent calibration. The opposite was observed for MNG and dinotefuran due to a matrix suppression effect. UF recovery was consistent in both matrix-matched and solvent calibrations despite having little suppressive effect. The method was successfully applied and dinotefuran and its metabolite residues were found in field-incurred green tea samples. The current findings suggest that using methanol as an appropriate QuEChERS solvent for problematic polar pesticides and investigating a suitable partitioning salt would considerably strengthen the practical impact of such data.",

The samples were initially subjected to acetonitrile extraction followed by cleanup using lab-made florisil/graphitized carbon black mixed solid phase extraction (SPE) column (for the different teas and soil samples) and a BondElut C18-SPE column (for the black tea infusion samples). Separation of the analytes was performed on a chiral stationary phase using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) under a reversed-phase isocratic elution mode followed by tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/MS) detection. The mobile phase components, mobile phase ratios, flow rates, column temperatures, and MS parameters were all optimized to reach high sensitivity and selectivity, good peak shape, and satisfactory resolution. The performance of the method was evaluated based on the sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and matrix effects. Under optimal conditions, for the various teas (green tea, black tea, and puer tea), fresh tea leaf, soil and black tea infusion samples spiked at low, medium, and high levels, the mean recoveries for the four enantiomers ranged from 61.0% to 129.7% with most relative standard deviations (RSDs) being 17.1% or below. Good linearity can be achieved with regression coefficients (R) of 0.9915 or above for all target enantiomers, and matrix-matched calibration concentration ranging from 5.0 to 1000μg/L. The limits of detection (LODs) for all four target enantiomers were 1.4μg/kg or below in the different teas and soil samples and 0.05μg/kg or below in the black tea infusion, whereas the limits of quantification (LOQs) for those did not exceed 5.0μg/kg and 0.2μg/L, respectively.

The PIL-MNPs were utilized as adsorbent phases in magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE).

The extraction method adopted the relatively commonly used approach of solid sample hydration, with the green tea hydrated before being extracted through salting out with acetonitrile followed by a cleanup procedure. The analytes were confirmed using GC-coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) with a triple quadrupole. The linearity of the calibration curves yielded determination coefficients (R(2)) >0.995. Recoveries were carried out using blank samples spiked with all analytes at two levels. The results demonstrated that all pesticides were recovered within the range of 77-116% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) ⩽14%. The quantification limits of 0.015-0.03 mg/kg were lower than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) for all analytes (0.05-10mg/kg). The infusion study indicated that cyhalothrin, flufenoxuron, and bifenthrin did not infuse into the tea brew from the made tea. Increases in brewing time resulted in increased transfer of azoxystrobin, fenitrothion, and difenoconazole from the made tea to the brew; however, this was not the case with triflumizole or EPN. We conclude that transfer of pesticides appeared to be dependent on their water solubilities and drinking a cup of tea is recommended to be at a water temperature of 60°C.",

In this work the transfer of difenoconazole and azoxystrobin residues from chrysanthemum tea to its infusion was investigated at different water temperatures, infusion intervals and times. The transfer percentages were in the range of 18.7-51.6% for difenoconazole and of 38.1-71.2% for azoxystrobin, and increased considerably with longer infusion intervals. The results indicated that azoxystrobin with a lower octanol-water partition coefficient of 2.5, showed a higher transfer than that of difenoconazole with a relatively high octanol-water partition coefficient of 4.4. Water temperature had no significant effect on the transfer of the two residues, and no obvious loss of difenoconazole and azoxystrobin occurred during the infusion process. The concentrations in the infusions decreased gradually from 0.67 to 0.30 μg kg(-1) for difenoconazole and from 2.3 to 0.46 μg kg(-1) for azoxystrobin after five infusions. To assess the potential health risk, the values of estimate expose risk were calculated to be 0.016 for difenoconazole and 0.0022 for azoxystrobin, meaning the daily residue intake of the two analytes from chrysanthemum tea was safe. This research may help assure food safety and identify the potential exposure risks from pesticides in chrysanthemum that may be health concerns.",

        "abstract": "Background. Increasing concern is evident about contamination of foodstuffs and natural health products. Methods. Common off-the-shelf varieties of black, green, white, and oolong teas sold in tea bags were used for analysis in this study. Toxic element testing was performed on 30 different teas by analyzing (i) tea leaves, (ii) tea steeped for 3-4 minutes, and (iii) tea steeped for 15-17 minutes. Results were compared to existing preferred endpoints. Results. All brewed teas contained lead with 73% of teas brewed for 3 minutes and 83% brewed for 15 minutes having lead levels considered unsafe for consumption during pregnancy and lactation. Aluminum levels were above recommended guidelines in 20% of brewed teas. No mercury was found at detectable levels in any brewed tea samples. Teas contained several beneficial elements such as magnesium, calcium, potassium, and phosphorus. Of trace minerals, only manganese levels were found to be excessive in some black teas. Conclusions. Toxic contamination by heavy metals was found in most of the teas sampled. Some tea samples are considered unsafe. There are no existing guidelines for routine testing or reporting of toxicant levels in \"naturally\" occurring products. Public health warnings or industry regulation might be indicated to protect consumer safety.",

From this study, residue levels of bifenazate at different harvest intervals, persistence, dissipation pattern during processing, rate constant and half-life values were calculated. Residues of bifenazate dissipated exponentially after spraying and at Gudalur trial, on the 16th day after application residues were below the maximum residue level of 0.02 mg/kg set by the European Union. However, no residues were detected in the tea brew. Regression lines drawn for bifenazate showed that it followed first order dissipation kinetics. Half-life values varied from 1.03 to 1.36 days for bifenazate and a pre-harvest interval of 16 days is suggested.",

In this study, the stereoselective determination of dichlorprop enantiomers in tea samples such as green, black, jasmine, and oolong was developed by ultra performance LC with fluorescence spectrometry after covalent chiral derivatization. The separation was achieved on an Acquity BEH C18 column with the mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile/water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. In the covalent chiral derivatization using (S)-(+)-4-(N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl)-7-(3-aminopyrrolidin-1-yl)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole, the peak resolution between the S and R-dichlorprop enantiomers was 2.6. LODs and LOQs values were 10 and 50 ng/mL standard solution. The linearity of the calibration curves yielded the coefficients (r(2) > 0.99, ranging from 0.05 to 5 μg/mL) of determination of each of the dichlorprop enantiomers. SPE extraction was used for the sample preparation of dichlorprop in various tea samples. Recoveries were in the range of 82.4-97.6% with associated precision values (within-day: 82.4-95.8%, n = 6, and between-day: 83.7-97.6% for 3 days) for repeatability and reproducibility. Based on this result, our method has been proven to be highly efficient and suitable for the routine assay of dichlorprop enantiomers in various tea samples.

Fenvalerate was measured by the increase of electron transfer resistance when the immune reaction occurred with Fe(CN)6(3-)/Fe(CN)6(4-) as the probe. Under optimal conditions, the change of resistance is in a linear relationship with the logarithm of the concentration in the range of 1.0×10(-3)∼1.0×10(1)mg/L (R=0.998) with a detection limit of 0.80 μg/L. This method bears such merits as simplicity of operation, high sensitivity, wide linear range, specificity, reproducibility and good stability.

HCHs could accumulate in most of the plant tissues, with the highest HCH concentration of 3.0±2.9ng/g dw in old leaves. Uptake of HCHs by the roots from soil was the possible pathway for HCHs accumulation in plants, and the accumulation was an isomer-selective process, with the highest concentration factor of 10.3 for α-HCH. The higher percentages of α- and γ-HCH in roots (28.1 percent and 43.7 percent) than those in soil (14.0% and 34.1 percent) also implied the isomer-selective accumulation of HCHs. ΣHCHs in the gaseous phase (157±97pg/m(3)) were significantly higher than those in particle phase (19±20pg/m(3)). Volatilization of HCHs from soils and uptake by the plant's aerial tissues might be the pathway for HCHs accumulation in leaves and stems, and β-HCH showed the highest accumulation capacity in young leaves. The percentage distribution pattern of the dust on plant leaves were similar to that in soils, suggesting that the dust on the leaves were mainly from the soils. High γ-HCH concentrations and low α-/γ-HCH ratios in plant's aerial tissues suggested the input of lindane in tea garden.",

Its compounds, at levels present in foodstuffs and drinks, are generally considered to be safe for consumption, but for individuals who already suffer from contact allergy to Ni and may be subject to develop systemic reactions from its dietary ingestion, dietary exposure to Ni must be kept under control. Being the second most popular beverage, tea is a potential source of dietary Ni. Present knowledge on its speciation in tea infusions is poor. Therefore, complete speciation analysis, consisting of separation by liquid chromatography using a weak CIM DEAE-1 monolithic column, \"on-line\" detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and \"off-line\" identification of ligands by hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS), was implemented for the first time to study Ni speciation in tea infusions. Total concentrations of Ni in dry leaves of white, green, oolong and black tea (Camellia sinensis) and flowers of herbal chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa) tea were determined after microwave digestion by ICP-MS. They lay between 1.21 and 14.4 mg kg(-1). Good agreement between the determined and the certified values of the Ni content in the standard reference material SRM 1573a tomato leaves confirmed the accuracy of the total Ni determination. During the infusion process, up to 85 % of Ni was extracted from tea leaves or flowers. Separation of Ni species was completed in 10 min by applying aqueous linear gradient elution with 0.6 mol L(-1) NH(4)NO(3). Ni was found to be present in the chromatographic fraction in which quinic acid was identified by Q-TOF in all the tea infusions analysed, which had pH values between 5.6 and 6.0. The only exception was the infusion of hibiscus tea with a pH of 2.7, where results of speciation analysis showed that Ni is present in its divalent ionic form.",

Since fate and behavior in soil have been only monitored sparsely and fragmentarily until today, laboratory tests were performed on sorption, leaching, biotransformation and photo-induced biotransformation of flubendiamide in two different soils. In batch equilibrium tests, K(d) and K(OC) values were 15 and 298 L kg(-1) for the Japanese tea field soil as well as 16 and 1610 L kg(-1) for the German arable field soil classifying flubendiamide to be moderately mobile and slightly mobile, respectively. The affinity to the tea field soil was additionally confirmed by soil column tests where flubendiamide was predominantly retarded in the topsoil layers resulting in a percolate contamination of only 0.002 mg L(-1). In the aerobic biotransformation tests, flubendiamide did not substantially disappear within the 122-d incubation period. Due to DT(50)>122 d, flubendiamide was assessed very persistent. Supplementary, photo-induced impacts on biotransformation were studied in a special laboratory irradiation system. Despite a 14-d irradiation period, photo-induced biotransformation in the tea field soil was not identifiable, neither by HPLC/DAD nor by LC/MS/MS. 3-d irradiation tests in photosensibilizing acetone, however, showed that the primary photo-transformation product desiodo-flubendiamide was formed.

        "abstract": "Efficient clean-up is indispensable for preventing matrix effects in multi-residue analysis of pesticides in food by liquid and gas chromatography (LC and GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). High-throughput planar solid phase extraction (HTpSPE) was recently introduced as a new clean-up concept in residue analysis of pesticides in fruit and vegetables (C. Oellig, W. Schwack, 2011 [45]). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used to completely separate pesticides from matrix compounds and to focus them into a sharp zone, followed by extraction of the target zone by the TLC-MS interface. As rather challenging matrices, tea samples were chosen in this study. Besides chlorophylls and polyphenols, high amount of caffeine is co-extracted resulting in strong matrix effects both in LC-MS and GC-MS. The former HTpSPE procedure was adapted to initial extracts of green and black tea resulting in colorless extracts nearly free of matrix effects and interferences, as shown for seven chemically representative pesticides (acetamiprid, penconazole, azoxystrobin, chlorpyrifos, pirimicarb, fenarimol, and mepanipyrim). LC-MS/MS calibration curves obtained in the range of 0.002-0.5 mg/kg from matrix-matched standards and solvent standards were nearly identical and demonstrated the effectiveness of clean-up by HTpSPE. Mean recoveries determined by LC-MS/MS against solvent standards at spiking levels of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg ranged between 72 and 114% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.7-4.7% (n=4), while LC-MS measurements of tea samples spiked at 1 mg/kg provided recoveries of 81-104% with RSDs of 1.2-4.9% (n=6). Using LC-MS/MS, the method showed high sensitivity with signal-to-noise ratios>10 for concentrations below 0.002 mg/kg. HTpSPE of one sample was done in a few minutes, while numerous samples were cleaned in parallel at minimal costs with very low sample and solvent consumption.",

A substantial simplification of sample processing prior to the quantification step was achieved: after addition of water to a homogenised sample, transfer of analytes into an acetonitrile layer was aided by the addition of inorganic salts. Bulk co-extracts, contained in the crude organic extract obtained by partition, were subsequently removed by liquid-liquid extraction using hexane with the assistance of added 20% (w/w) aqueous NaCl solution. The importance of matrix hydration prior to the extraction for achieving good recoveries was demonstrated on tea samples with incurred pesticide residues. For most of the analytes, recoveries in the acceptable range of 70-120% and repeatabilities (relative standard deviations, RSDs) ≤20% were achieved for both matrices at spiking levels of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg kg(-1). Under optimised GC-MS/MS conditions, most of the analytes gave lowest calibration level ≤0.01 mg kg(-1), permitting the control at the maximum residue levels (MRLs) laid down in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.

        "abstract": "Due to the similarity in ionic radius, perchlorate has been reported to inhibit the iodide intake in the thyroid gland, which may lead to low heart rate, weight gain, and fatigue. In recent years, the presence of perchlorate in drinking water, surface water, soil, and food supplies in the United States has raised a great concern on establishing the maximum residue limit (MRL) for perchlorate to reduce its possible adverse influence on human health. US EPA currently puts perchlorate on the final third Contamination Candidate List (CCL3) and suggests a health reference level at 4.9 μg L⁻¹. The MRL of perchlorate was therefore set at 5.0 μg L⁻¹ by the authors for method validation. In this study, large volume injection (up to 1-mL) and online solid phase extraction (SPE) were utilized for pre-concentrating perchlorate ions and removing unretained matrix components prior to reversed-phase HPLC analysis using ESI-tandem MS under the negative mode. After eluting perchlorate from online SPE, 0.1% formic acid solution was utilized for isocratic HPLC analysis without any organic solvent. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and the internal standard, Cl₁₈O₄⁻, were utilized for quantitatively determining perchlorate in bottled water and bottled tea samples. Two linear ranges, 0.05-0.50 μg L⁻¹ and 0.50-10.00 μg L⁻¹, were established to better estimate the residual amounts of perchlorate in bottled water samples with a method detection limit (MDL, signal-to-noise ratio of 3) of 0.01 μg L⁻¹. The linear range was 1.50-10.00 μg L⁻¹ for bottled tea samples with a MDL of 0.5 μg L⁻¹. In addition, the proposed method was further validated based on the EU Commission Decision 2002/657/EC, including within-laboratory reproducibility, decision limit (CCα), and detection capability (CCβ) for bottled water and bottled tea samples. The intra-day/inter-day precision and accuracy as well as within-laboratory reproducibility were determined by calculating the relative standard deviation (RSD) at three spiked levels (0.5 MRL, 1 MRL, 1.5 MRL). The within-laboratory reproducibility (n=18) for both bottled water and bottled tea samples, spiked at MRL (5.0 μg L⁻¹) of ClO₄⁻, was less than 10%.

Multi-elementary analysis was carried out by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). It was concluded that the concentrations of those leached metals depend on the nature of the migration liquids, the type of teapots and the contact periods. Most teapots showed a high level of toxic metals in leachates for lead and to a less extent for nickel, which can contribute significantly to the risk of serious poisoning.

DTPA-extractable As was primarily restricted to surface horizons. Arsenic speciation study showed the presence of higher As(V) concentrations in the upper horizon and its gradual decrease with the increase in soil depths, following a decrease of Eh. As fractionation by sequential extraction in all the soil profiles showed that arsenic concentrations in the three most labile fractions (i.e., water-soluble, exchangeable and carbonate-bound fractions) were generally low. Most arsenic in soils was nominally associated with the organic and Fe-Mn oxide fractions, being extractable in oxidizing or reducing conditions. DTPA-extractable As (assumed to represent plant-available As) was found to be strongly correlated to the labile pool of As (i.e. the sum of the first three fractions). The statistical comparison of means (two-sample t-test) showed the presence of significant differences between the concentrations of As(III) and As(V) for different soil locations, depths and fractions. The risk assessment code (RAC) was found to be below the pollution level for all soils. The measurement of arsenic uptake by different parts of tea plants corroborated the hypothesis that roots act as a buffer and hold back contamination from the aerial parts.",

The new method includes tea extraction and dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) to prepare gas chromatography (GC) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-ready samples, providing a fast and cost-effective solution for time-sensitive industrial analysis to fulfill regulatory requirements. Both GC-negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-NCI-MS) and UHPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) were employed to produce highly sensitive and reproducible data. Excellent limits of detection (typically below 1 μg/kg for GC and 10 μg/kg for UHPLC), wide linearity ranges, and good recoveries (mostly >70%) were achieved on the selected pesticides. Twenty-seven tea samples purchased from local grocery stores were analyzed using the newly developed methods. Among the pesticides analyzed, endosulfan sulfate and kelthane were the most frequently detected by GC-NCI-MS and imidacloprid and acetamiprid by UHPLC-MS/MS in these teas.

The six major constituents of the pyrethrins (pyrethrin I and II, jasmolin I and II, and cinerin I and II) were successfully separated and independently confirmed in a single run within approximately 5 min. The multi-residue analysis of pyrethrins in teas involved simply extraction with acetonitrile, clean-up using a multilayer solid phase extraction cartridge, and subsequent separation by a hydrophilic end-capped Aquasil C18 columns with detection by tandem mass spectrometry using an electrospray ionization source in positive mode (ESI+). Recovery studies were carried out at three spiked levels (0.05, 0.1, 0.5 mg kg(-1)). The overall average recoveries using this method in green teas and black teas at the three concentration levels ranged from 76.15% to 101.86% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) in the range of 2.71-12.93% (n=5) for all analytes.

Under optimized conditions, the linearity of the developed method was in the range of 0.125-25 ng/mL with correlation coefficients greater than 0.9928 and the limits of detections (LODs) were 0.027-0.23 ng/mL (S/N=3).

The fiber had high extraction efficiency for studied pesticides in comparison with commercial poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and polyacrylate (PA) fibers and could be used for more than 70 times without decrease of efficiency. The developed method was successfully applied for the analysis of real samples including green Tea, oolong Tea, white Tea, and flower Tea, and the recoveries of the pesticides spiked in these samples ranged from 75.1 to 118.4%.

Site-specific exposure parameters such as body weight and consumption rate of Puerh tea were investigated in Kunming and Puer cities using face-to-face surveys. Health risks were evaluated for the inhabitants of Kunming and Puer cities by gender and by age groups.

Both the HQ (Hazard Quotient) values for single elements and the HI (Hazard Index) value for all seven elements were far below one, indicating no non-carcinogenic risks from these seven elements for inhabitants of Kunming and Puer under the current consumption rates of Puerh tea.

        "abstract": "Puerh tea is a unique Chinese fermented tea. Unlike other teas it is stored for a long period of time. Aspergillus niger is claimed to be the dominant microorganism in the Puerh tea manufacturing process and also to be common on tea in general. A. niger sensu stricto is known to produce the mycotoxins ochratoxin A, fumonisins B(2) and B(4). With this in mind, we performed a preliminary study to determine if production of these mycotoxins by black Aspergilli isolated from Puerh and black tea can occur. An examination of 47 isolates from Puerh tea and black tea showed that none of these was A. niger. A part of the calmodulin gene in 17 isolates were sequenced, and these 17 isolates were all identified as Aspergillus acidus (=A. foetidus var. acidus). The rest of the 47 isolates were also identified as A. acidus from their metabolite profile. Neither production of ochratoxin A nor fumonisins B(2) and B(4) by any of the 47 isolates were observed.",

A mixture of acetonitrile and n-hexane was used as an extraction solvent for the extraction of OPPs from tea samples. When the extraction process was finished, the mixture of solvents was rapidly dispersed in water; target analyte was extracted to a small volume of n-hexane, using DLLME. Recovery tests were performed for concentration 5.0 microg/kg. The recovery for each target analyte was in the range between 83.3 and 117.4%. The repeatability of the proposed method, expressed as relative standard deviation, varied between 3 and 7.8% (n=3). The detection limit of the method for tea was found ranging from 0.030 to 1 microg/kg for all the target pesticides. Compared with the conventional sample preparation method, the proposed method has the advantage of being quick and easy to operate, and has high-enrichment factors and low consumption of organic solvent.",

This study has three aims: (1) to measure the concentrations of arsenic and heavy metal elements, such as chromium, cadmium, and lead, as well as the essential trace elements contained in dried tea leaves of the common brands in Taiwan; (2) to determine the percentage released and concentration of each of these elements after infusion of these tea leaves with boiling water; (3) to assess the carcinogenic risk from daily tea consumption, to provide reference values for the general public. This study showed the total content of arsenic and heavy metals in green tea, oolong tea, and black tea produced in Taiwan was 0.11, 5.61, and 10.11 microg/g, respectively, indicating that the level of arsenic and heavy metal contamination of tea leaves was lower in Taiwan than other regions of the world.

In this study, we investigated Cu accumulation in tea leaves produced in Yuyao County in China. Copper concentrations in all tea leaves sampled from tea gardens were below 60mgkg(-1), the permissible level given by the Chinese Ministry of Health; however, 15% of the samples were over 15mgkg(-1), the allowable level of 'green food' as defined by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture. These observations indicate that Cu concentrations in tea leaves from the investigated producing areas are acceptable, but still a concern. To understand what factors affect the Cu accumulation in the tea leaves, we further analyzed soils from the tea gardens for Cu availability, pH and organic matter content. The Cu availability in soil was found to be closely correlated with the soil's H+ activity, followed by organic matter content. The soils in the tea gardens were also found to be severely acidic with the lowest pH of 3.58. The tea garden soils, if fertilized with animal manure, could also contribute to the risk of Cu contamination. Additionally, Cu concentrations in the final products of tea leaves were greatly increased by the machinery processing in factories that used copper boards at the twisting stage. In one factory, the Cu level was increased by 32.1mgkg(-1). This study suggests that both edaphic and non-edaphic factors can contribute to the final Cu accumulation in tea leaves used by consumers.",

Arsenic including species totalling to 47 Chinese tea samples from 18 tea-producing provinces in China were analyzed. By simulating the infusion process, leaching characters, effects of extraction time and temperature on arsenic extraction were investigated. Total amount of arsenic in tea leaf samples was in the range below the detection limit to 4.81 microg/g. Leaching of arsenic was strongly affected by extraction time and temperature. Because arsenic leaching ability by hot water was low and most of the arsenic was left in tea leaf residues after infusion, the concentration of arsenic in tea infusion was low even when some original tea leaf samples contained high level of arsenic. The major species in tea infusion were inorganic arsenic form (arsenite As(III) and arsenate As(V)). Compared with the amount of arsenic in infusion, more organic arsenic species were found in the original tea leaf samples. The contents of extractable inorganic arsenic in tea leaf samples were in the range below the detection limit to 226 ng/g.

        "abstract": "Tea is a widely consumed beverage. However, recent studies revealed that there were an increasing number of cases of tea products exceeding the former maximum permissible concentration (MPC) in China for Pb (2 mg kg(-1)). Tea Pb contamination is an issue affecting trade and consumer confidence. Root uptake of Pb could contribute significantly to Pb accumulation in tea leaves due to the strong acidity of many tea garden soils. We conducted pot and field experiments to evaluate the effect of liming on Pb uptake by tea plants on two highly acidic soils (pH3.6). Additions of CaCO(3) significantly increased soil pH by up to 1 unit and decreased soil extractable Pb by up to 32%. Liming resulted in a decrease in the proportion of Pb in the exchangeable and carbonate-bound fractions, with a concurrent increase in the fractions bound to Fe/Mn oxides and residues. Liming significantly decreased Pb concentrations of fine roots, stems and new shoots of tea plants in the pot experiment. In the field experiments, the effect of liming was not significant during the first year following CaCO(3) application, but became significant during the second and third years and Pb concentration in the new shoots was decreased by approximately 20-50%, indicating that liming of acidic tea garden soils is an effective way to reduce Pb contamination of tea. The study also reveals a distinct seasonal variation, with Pb concentration in the new shoots following the order of spring>autumn>summer.",

        "abstract": "In this work, microwave-assisted steam distillation (MASD) extraction method followed by gas chromatography/electron capture detection (GC/ECD) was developed for the determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and pyrethroids in the Chinese teas. MASD is a combination of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and steam distillation techniques. Water vapor generated by microwave irradiation is used to accelerate desorption of the analytes from the sample, and the nonpolar organic solvent used for trapping the analytes is kept from direct contact with the sample by the water. Therefore, relatively clean extracts were obtained compared to the method directly using organic solvent as extraction solvent, such as ultrasonic extraction (USE). Microwave power of 200W and irradiation time of 2min was found to be the optimum conditions for the MASD process, and n-heptane was chosen as the analyte-trapping solvent in the study. Five OCPs (alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, dicofol, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT) and two pyrethroids (bifenthrin, fenvalate) were determined using this extraction method in the tea samples. The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of the analytes varied from 2.2 to 8.4%, and the method detection limits (MDLs) found were lower than 0.23mug/kg. The recoveries of the seven compounds in the Jasmine tea sample were between 84.04 and 110.1%. Comparative results obtained by MASD and USE were also discussed in the study.",

The fission yield of (95)Zr is as high as 6.2%, however, its environmental behavior has not been well documented. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the accumulation and distribution of (95)Zr in a tea plant/soil system. (95)Zr was accumulated primarily in the trunk of tea plants after being taken up from the soil. The radioactivity concentration of (95)Zr in the trunk increased slowly with time, then it reached a dynamic equilibrium 14 days after application. The radioactivity concentration of (95)Zr in the other parts of the tea plant was very low; only slighter greater than the detection limit. The results indicated that (95)Zr was not readily translocated in the tea plant. About 98.9% of applied (95)Zr was found to concentrate in the upper 5 cm layer after being sprayed onto the soil surface. The results indicated that (95)Zr could not readily move downwards with percolating water due to strong adsorption to surface soil.",

There was an increasing trend in tea Pb concentration from 1989 to 2000. Proximity to highway and surface dust contamination were found to cause elevated Pb concentrations in tea leaves. Furthermore, Pb concentration in tea leaves correlated significantly and positively with soil extractable Pb, and negatively with soil pH, suggesting that root uptake of Pb from soils also contributed to Pb accumulation in tea.

        "abstract": "Recent tests have detected high lead (Pb) concentrations in some commercial brands of tea leaves and this finding has raised concerns due to the possible health-related problems associated with Pb poisoning. In present research, we investigated the Pb contamination in tea leaves produced in Zhejiang province in China. Pb concentrations in all tea leaves sampled were below 5 mg/kg, the permissible levels given by Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, indicating that Pb contamination in this province is not excessive. We then investigated the non-edaphic factors that may potentially contribute to Pb accumulation in tea leaves. Pb concentration in tea leaves was found to be positively correlated with the industrialization level of a district (R = 0.83, the significant level at P < 0.05), and greater amounts of Pb were washed from the leaves of plants in districts with more industrial activity. This suggests that Pb accumulation in tea leaves could, in part, be attributed to industrial activity through the precipitation of atmospheric Pb. Furthermore greater amounts of Pb were washed from the leaves of plants growing near road than those growing farther away from road. This trend indicates that automobile activity was another likely contributor to Pb accumulation in tea. Pb content of green tea was also affected by the processing of the leaves in the factory. In particular the twisting and water-removal stages caused increases in Pb content in the tea product. This study suggests that non-edaphic factors also contribute to the Pb accumulation in tea.",

        "abstract": "The consumption of heavy metals is detrimental to human health and most countries restrict the concentration of metals such as lead (Pb) in food and beverages. Recent tests have detected high Pb concentrations in certain commercial brands of tea leaves and this finding has raised concerns for both producers and consumers. To investigate what factors may be contributing to the increase in Pb accumulation in the tea leaves we collected tea leaves and soils from tea producing areas and analyzed them for Pb concentration, pH and organic matter content. The result showed the Pb concentration of 47% investigated tea leaves samples was beyond 2 mg kg(-1), the permissible levels given by China. The total Pb concentration in the surface and subsurface soil layers averaged 36.4 and 32.2 mg kg(-1), respectively which fall below of the 60 mg kg(-1) limit provided for organic tea gardens in China. The pH of the tea garden soils was severely acidic with the lowest pH of 3.37. Soils under older tea gardens tended to have a lower pH and a higher Pb bioavailability which was defined as the amount of lead extracted by CaCl2 solution than those under younger tea gardens. We found that the concentration of bioavailable Pb and the percentage of bioavailable Pb (bioavailable Pb relative to total Pb concentration) were positively correlated with soil H+ activity and soil organic matter content, and the organic matter accumulation contribute more effects on Pb bioavailability in these two factors. We conclude that soil acidification and organic matter accumulation could contribute to increasing Pb bioavailability in soil and that these could increase Pb uptake and accumulation in the tea leaves.",

The aim of his study was to determine the contamination of black, green, red and white teas by PAHs. In this investigation, content of 23 PAH, i.e 16 EPA PAH and 15 EU PAH were determined in 18 brands of tea and its infusions. The analytical procedure was based on ultrasonic extraction for dried tea and liquid-liquid extraction for infusions. All samples were cleaned up by florisil cartridge. The total content of 23 PAH varied between 22.9 microg/kg to 2945.5 microg/kg and 2.7 microg/kg to 63,1 microg/kg microg/kg for BaP. The analysed tea samples showed an increasing presence of PAH in the following order (mean value): black tea < red tea < green tea < white tea.

The infusions prepared from these teas were also analyzed for PCDD/PCDF. The levels of DDT and its metabolites in tea leaves were within the safety limit of 0.2 mg/kg. Rather high levels of total PAH were obtained in brick tea (1,048-1,162 mg/kg). when compared with green tea (497-517 mg/kg). In terms of PCDD/PCDF, the concentrations of green tea and brick tea differed by a factor of 16, while the concentrations of all infusions were within a factor of 2. The dioxin concentrations in green tea leaves can be explained through uptake of atmospheric PCDD/PCDF. The higher concentrations in the brick tea leaves are due the longer exposure time, and to certain extent, the use of old leaves, branches and roots when making the tea, and additional components such as soil particulates through contamination. Certain Chinese populations drinking a large amount of brick tea (>31 per day) indicated that individuals of these populations consume more tea than Europeans or North Americans result in a comparably higher intake of PCDD/PCDF. Tea consumption can attribute to up to 10% of the TDI recommended by WHO (only PCDD/PCDF considered, no PCB analyzed).",

The chromatographic and MS parameters influencing separation and sensitivity were optimized, and major factors affecting the extraction and cleanup efficiency including type and volume of extraction solvent, extraction time, type and amount of cleanup sorbent, and clean-up time were investigated. The performance of the method was evaluated. Under optimum conditions, satisfactory linear relationship was observed with the content of PCBs ranging from 5 to 500 μg/kg, with correlation coefficients (<i>r</i>) no less than 0.9998. The 18 PCBs in three kinds of tea matrices including Biluochun tea, Tieguanyin tea and Pu'er tea were spiked at 5, 10 and 100 μg/kg to evaluate recoveries, which ranged from 90.7% to 115.2% with relative standard deviations (<i>n</i>=5) between 0.3% and 10.9%. The limits of detection and the limits of quantification were 0.3-1.7 μg/kg and 5 μg/kg for each PCB, respectively. The method is simple, rapid, accurate, sensitive and effective, and is suitable for the determination of the 18 PCBs in different kinds of tea.",

PAHs were separated within 15 min by HPLC using a Zorbax Eclipse PAH column with a water/acetonitrile gradient elution program as the mobile phase. The optimum in-tube SPME conditions were 20 draw/eject cycles of 40 µL of sample using a CP-Sil 19CB capillary column as an extraction device. Low- and high-molecular weight PAHs were extracted effectively onto the capillary coating from 5% and 30% methanol solutions, respectively. The extracted PAHs were readily desorbed from the capillary by passage of the mobile phase. Good linearity of the calibration curve (r > 0.9972) was obtained in the concentration range of 0.05-2.0 ng mL-1, and the detection limits (S/N = 3) of PAHs were 0.32-4.63 pg mL-1. Using the in-tube SPME/HPLC-FLD method, PAHs were detected at ng g-1 levels in the samples without interference peaks. Our results suggest that PAHs contamination in herbal products is widespread, and the proposed method may become a useful tool for monitoring PAH contamination and quality control in herbal products.",

Most arsenic and cadmium absorbed were fixed in feeding roots and only small amount was transported to the above-ground parts. Distribution of arsenic and cadmium, based on their concentrations of unit dry matter, in tea plants grown on un-contaminated soil was in the order: feeding roots>stems approximately main roots>old leaves>young leaves. When tea plants were grown on polluted soils simulated by adding salts of these two metals, feeding roots possibly acted as a buffer and defense, and arsenic and cadmium were transported less to the above-ground parts. The concentration of cadmium in soil significantly and negatively correlated with chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and biomass production of tea plants.",

Tea addition reduced somewhat heavy metal toxicity due possibly to the complexing ability of tea. Chemical analysis of teapot leachates showed that some contained zinc and copper. Teapot No. 5, which showed the highest toxicity, also displayed the highest Zn concentration (7.39 mg/l), confirming the toxicity data.

Arsenic, selenium and mercury are mainly present in the bark, the root and the old leaves of tea sapling, nevertheless, the bismuth contents in the root and the bark-deprived trunk are so low that they can not be determined accurately.

Millions of individual world-wide are suffering from the arsenic and other heavy metal related diseases due to the consumption of contaminated groundwater. 60 water samples from different sources of 6 small tea gardens of Sonitpur district were collected to study the potability of water for drinking purposes. The water samples collected from sources like tube wells, ring wells and ponds were analyzed for arsenic, heavy metals like iron, manganese and mercury with sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, pH, total hardness, chloride, fluoride and sulphate. Some drain water samples of the tea garden areas were also collected to analyze the above mentioned water parameters to see the contamination level. Experiments revealed that 78% samples of total collection had arsenic content above the permissible limit (0.01 ppm) of WHO guideline value for drinking water. The highest arsenic was observed 0.09 ppm at one sample of Gobindra Dahal tea garden of Gohpur sub division of Sonitpur district. 94% samples had contamination due to manganese 39% samples had iron and 44% samples had Hg. The water quality data was subjected to some statistical treatments like NDA, cluster analysis and pearson correlation to observe the distribution pattern of the different water quality parameters. A strong pearson correlation coefficient was observed between parameters-arsenic and manganese (0.865) and arsenic and mercury (0.837) at 0.01 level, indicated the same sources of drinking water contamination.",

Accordingly the spectral correction element is targeted at the copper elements located near the energy center(8 keV). The copper elements are also used as the picketage to be the standard curve. In the energy segment of effective X-ray fluorescence photons contained in the tea 1.25 mg · kg(-1) of the average detection limit was obtained by using the spiked method to analyze four elements of copper, iron, zinc and lead. Compared with the flame atomic absorption spectrum(FAAS), the actual relative error of the tested value by EDXRF is less than 6%, and the relative standard deviation is less than 5%. The result by T test shows that p > 0.05. The conclusions are that there are no statistically significant differences between EDXRF and FAAS. The measured results gained by the two methods agree with each other. And EDXRF can be used thoroughly to test the metal contents contained in the tea. The result shows that it is feasible to test the metallic contents contained in the tea by EDXRF, and its measured result can meet the requirements of field testing and analysis.",

This examination was expected to answer the question whether infusions or decoctions may constitute the additional source of these elements, or whether the amounts of nickel and chromium included in them may be dangerous for the human organism. The samples were dry mineralized at the temperature of 450 degrees C. Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was performed using SOLAAR M5 appliance produced by a US-based Thermo Elemental company; nickel contents were determined from the organic phase, and chromium directly from the mineralisate. Nickel contents ranged on average from 0.56 microg/g to 2.68 microg/g in herbs and from 0.99 microg/g to 1.70 microg/g in herbal fruit teas. On average 40.0% to 82.5% of the amount present in dry, raw material passed into the infusions. The determined amounts of chromium ranged from 0.57 microg/g to 1.36 microg/g in herbs, and from 0.47 microg/g to 1.17 microg/g in herbal fruit teas (average values). The maximum extraction of this element into the infusion or decoction equaled 85.0%. The contents of nickel and chromium in the examined dry herb samples were comparable to results obtained by authors of the other papers.

        "abstract": "In this paper, confocal Raman spectroscopy was applied to detect the contents of lead chrome green as a heavy-metal stain illegally added in tea. Firstly, Raman spectra of five different concentrations of lead chrome green in tea infusion were acquired based on specific concentration method. The qualitative analysis of sample added with lead chrome green was achieved with comparing the Raman spectra of sample and standard substance. Four main Raman characteristic wavenumbers, 1 341, 1 451, 1 527 and 1 593 cm(-1), were extracted for the qualitative identification of lead chrome green in tea. After spectral preprocessing of the raw Raman spectra, backward interval PLS (biPLS), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and successive projections algorithm (SPA) were combined to deeply mine the characteristic wavenumbers of lead chrome green in Raman spectra, and finally 14 characteristic wavenumbers were optimized. Partial least squares (PLS) and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) were separately used to build the model based on the extracted 14 wavenumbers. As a result, these two models both had good robustness and high ability to predict and all the determination coefficient (R(2)) of calibration, validation and prediction were higher than 0.9, which proved the effectiveness of the extracted characteristic wavenumbers. Compared with the PLS model, the nonlinear model built by LS-SVM got a better result, R(2) of prediction was 0.964 and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.535. This study indicated that it is feasible to detect the contents of lead chrome green illegally added in tea based on confocal Raman spectroscopy combined with specific sample treatment and chemometrics methods.

Furthermore, micronutrient contents in tea infusion depend on infusion procedure as well as on the instrument used for analysis. The proportion of micronutrients found in different tea types are 1.0-88.9% for B, 10-60% for Co, 2.0-97.8% for Cu, 67.8-89.9% for Fe, 71.0-87.4% for Mn, 13.3-34% for Mo, and 34.9-83% for Zn.

        "keywords": "spectrometry,analyte,absorbance,absorption,preconcentration,samples",
        "abstract": "One of the limitations in previous flow injection (FI) sorption preconcentration procedures in a knotted reactor (KR), which have been carried out exclusively with a single continuous sample injection over a certain period, is the relatively low retention efficiency (typically 40-50%). Although the sensitivity of such systems could be improved by properly increasing sample preconcentration time, sample loading flow rate, or both, further improvement of the sensitivity has been limited by the narrow linearity of the relationship between signal intensity and preconcentration time or sample loading time. In this work, a novel on-line FI multiplexed sorption preconcentration procedure with repetitive sample injections was developed to overcome the above problems in the previous systems. In contrast to previous FI preconcentration systems, the proposed multiplexed preconcentration procedure evenly divides a single longer sample injection step into several shorter substeps while the total preconcentration time is still kept constant. To demonstrate its merits, the proposed FI on-line KR multiplexed sorption preconcentration system was combined with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) for determination of trace lead in water, tea, and herb medicines. The lead in the sample solution on-line reacted with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and the resultant analyte complex was sorbed on the inner walls of the KR. The residual sample solution was then removed from the KR with an air flow. The above two steps were repeated eight times with a total preconcentration time of 120 s. The sorbed analyte was eluted from the KR with 4.5 mol L(-1) HCl for on-line FAAS detection. The present multiplexed preconcentration procedure with eight repetitive sample injections for a total preconcentration time of 120 s gave a retention efficiency of 92%, twice that obtained by one single sample injection preconcentration (47%). In addition, the linear ranges of the diagrams of absorbance against sample loading flow rate and sample loading time were extended, offering more potential for achieving high sensitivity by increasing sample loading rates or sample loading time compared to the previous one single continuous sample injection preconcentration procedure. At a sample loading flow rate of 3.6 mL min(-1) for a total preconcentration period of 120 s, an enhancement factor of 57 and a detection limit (3sigma) of 8 microg L(-1) were obtained. The precision was 1.4% (RSD, n = 11) at the 200 microg L(-1) level. The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of trace lead in various water samples, herb medicines, and a certified tea reference material.",

To evaluate the effect of pretreatment and the performance of the assay, serially diluted cultures of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus were tested. The improved methods, which consisted of a pretreatment of the sample in alkaline buffer, significantly decreased the background bioluminescence intensity of green tea samples when compared with the conventional method. Pretreatment with alkaline buffers with pH levels ranging from 8.0 to 9.0 increased the bioluminescence intensities of cultures of E. cloacae and S. aureus. Strong log-linear relationships between the bioluminescence intensities and plate counts emerged for the tested strains. Furthermore, the microbial detection limit was 15 CFU in 500 ml of bottled green tea after an 8-h incubation at 35°C and an assay time of 1 h.

        "abstract": "Forty-eight samples of four popular commercial brands of black tea (Camellia sinensis L.) were purchased from the local markets in Muscat area, Sultanate of Oman. Tea leaves were surveyed for mycoflora. Five fungal species were isolated with A. niger as the most dominant in all the brands having percentage contamination ranging between 0.66% and 30.34%. Other fungi isolated were Aspergillusflavus, Penicillium spp. and Pacelomyces spp. but having average percentages of 0.6%, 0.84% and 0.21% respectively. Significant differences were found among the batches contaminated by A. niger. None of the 25 A. flavus strains screened for aflatoxins were found aflatoxigenic. The total ash, water-soluble ash, and mineral concentration of the samples were within the British standards and were not affected by fungal contamination. The results showed that black tea is contaminated by fungi that might constitute health hazards for humans. The post harvest contamination of tea could be eliminated or reduced if processing is conducted under more hygienic conditions.",

A total of 87 samples, 18 black tea samples and 69 samples of four different medicinal plants (chamomile, leaves of the orange tree, leaves and flowers of the linden tree, and corn silk), for infusions preparations were acquired from supermarkets in Lisbon, Portugal. The samples were analyzed for the incidence and levels of fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2) by high-performance liquid chromatography. The detection limit was 20 microg/kg for both FB1 and FB2. FB1 was detected in 55 (65.5%) of the 87 samples. The highest number of positive samples was found in black tea (88.8%). with levels ranging from 80 to 280 microg/kg. Relative to the medicinal plants, the leaves of the orange tree had higher concentrations of FB1 (range, 350 to 700 microg/kg) followed by leaves and flowers of the linden tree (range, 20 to 200 microg/kg). The samples of corn silk and chamomile had less contamination of FB1, with concentrations ranging from 50 to 150 microg/kg and 20 to 70 microg/kg, respectively. None of the samples tested had contamination of FB2. This is the first report of the natural occurrence of fumonisins in black tea and medicinal plants in Portugal.

        "abstract": "Tea is a perennial plantation crop grown under monoculture providing favorable conditions for a variety of pests. The concept of pest control has undergone a considerable change over the past few decades. In recent years there has been a greater dependence on the use of pesticides (7.35-16.75 kgha(-1)) with little importance laid on other safe control methods for the management of tea pests. Due to this practice, the tea pests showed a higher tolerance/ resistance status due to formation of greater amount of esterases, glutathione S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase. Thus, over reliance on pesticides end up with pesticide residue in made tea (DDT - 10.4-47.1%; endosulfan - 41.1-98.0%; dicofol- 0.0-82.4%; ethion - 0.0-36.2%; cypermethrin - 6.0- 45.1%). The growing concern about the pesticide residue in made tea, its toxicity hazards to consumers, the spiraling cost of pesticides and their application have necessitated a suitable planning which will ensure a safe, economic as well as effective pest management in tea. At present it is a global concern to minimize chemical residue in tea and European union and German law imposed stringent measures for the application of chemicals in tea and fixed MRL values at < or = 0. 1 mgkg(-1) for the most commonly used pesticides which will not be met out in the real practice and has been a major constraint to tea exporting countries like India. In order to regulate the situation of the Indian market at global level, central insecticide board and prevention of food adulteration regulation committee have reviewed the MRL position for tea and has recommended 10 insecticides, 5 acaricides, 9 herbicides and 5 fungicides for use in tea and issued the tea distribution and export control order 2005 which will help the country to limit the presence of undesirable substances in tea. This review attempts to provide the readers with a comprehensive account of pesticide use in North East in tea, surveillance report of the European community regarding the residue level in Assam and Darjeeling tea, recent amendments by international and national regulatory bodies, revised MRL values of pesticides in tea, an update about the current strategies for the management of tea pests with more focus on the use of biological control agents and a possible beneficial role or judicious use of chemical pesticides in complement with other alternative measures to achieve optimum effects in terms of limiting agricultural input, lowering production costs, reducing environmental contamination and the effect on non-target organisms, delaying the development of resistant pest biotypes and above all minimizing the pesticide residues in tea to increase the exports.",

        "abstract": "Tea is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, and its quality is often affected by the excessive pesticide residues during production. During the detection of pesticide residues in tea by chromatography-mass spectrometry and other methods, a strong matrix effect attributed to tea polyphenols and pigments is observed, which seriously impacts the analysis results. In this study, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles and boric acid-functionalized metal organic framework (BA-MOF) materials were combined to prepare a highly efficient adsorbent Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@BA-MOF for capturing tea polyphenols and pigments. An effective analysis method for pesticide residues in tea samples in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was established. The introduction of boronic acid ligands into the metal organic framework, as the recognition site of <i>cis</i>-diols, enhanced the polyphenol capture ability. Adsorption of the pigment in the matrix was achieved through <i>&#x003c0;-&#x003c0;</i> interactions between the MOF ligand and the pigment. This new material has significant advantages such as rapid magnetic separation, large surface area, and abundant functional sites. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@BA-MOF was prepared by employing simple conditions and characterized by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry to identify its functional groups and morphology. After investigating the adsorption effect of different doses of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@BA-MOF adsorbents (5, 10, 30, 50, and 80 mg) on tea polyphenols, 50 mg of the adsorbent was added to the tea matrix and shaken thoroughly. The tea polyphenol content in the matrix solution was determined using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. The polyphenols were reduced by 74.58% within 5 min. The effect of solution pH (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 7.0) on the adsorption efficiency was investigated, and pH 7.0 was chosen as the optimal condition. By adjusting the pH of the solution, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@BA-MOF could be recycled, and it maintained the excellent adsorption performance after four cycles of use. The introduction of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles led to rapid magnetic response characteristics during sample pretreatment and improved the pretreatment efficiency. In the actual application of tea pesticide detection, after Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@BA-MOF pretreatment, the average recovery rates of the ten pesticides were in the range of 75.8%-138.6%, and the RSD was in the range of 0.5%-18.7% (<i>n</i>=3). The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@BA-MOF nanocomposite prepared by introducing the boric acid ligand into the MOF structure and incorporating Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles could specifically adsorb the tea polyphenol matrix. When applied to the detection of pesticide residues in tea, it purifies the matrix and improves the detection efficiency, thus being suitable for the detection and analysis of pesticides in tea.",

The objective of this research was to investigate the disappearance trend in tea of fenazaquin residue level and its transfer in brew. Fenazaquin was applied on a tea crop at two rates, 125 and 250 g A.I./ha in wet and dry seasons under field conditions. Samples (green shoots, made tea and its brew) were analyzed for fenazaquin and quantification was by high performance liquid chromatography using a UV detector. The residue dissipated faster in the wet season than in the dry season. Seven days after the treatment (normal round of plucking) the residues observed in green shoots at the two rates were 0.32, 0.50 mg/kg and 2.04, 2.84 mg/kg in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. However, the degradation rate in both seasons followed first order kinetics. Half lives in green shoots were in the range 1.20-1.32 and 2.10-2.21 days and in made tea 1.03-1.06 and 1.87-1.94 days for wet and dry seasons, respectively. During processing of green shoots to made tea considerable loss (42-70%) of residue was observed. The transfer of residue from made tea to brew was in the range 3-17%. In brew residues were below 0.003 mg/l after 5 days of application at both the rates in either of the seasons. The estimated intake with brew (normal consumption of 10 cup/day/adult) thus would be below the acceptable daily intake for fenazaquin (0.005 mg/kg-body weight). To avoid health hazards due to the toxic effect of residues in brew, a waiting period for plucking the tea shoots after fenazaquin application of more than 3 days for wet season and 5 days for dry season at recommended rate (125 g A.I./ha) may be suggested and considered quite safe.",

Kamalpur tea estate, Darjeeling; West Bengal, Teok tea Estate and AAU, Jorhat; Assam in India. Regardless of location and doses, residues of both the insecticides dissipated following first order kinetics. The half-life of Thiacloprid (4.93-5.38 days) was longer than that of deltamethrin (1.78-1.94 days). Processing of green tea leaves reduced the residue level of thiacloprid and deltamethrin in made tea. No residues of both these insecticides could be detected in tea infusion. With respect to the phenolic distribution in tea, a marked increase in total catechin monomers with thiacloprid and greater accumulation of EGCG and ECG (indices of phenol quality) with deltamethrin were observed.",

        "abstract": "Based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS), UNIFI 1.7.0 software was used to establish a screening and confirmation method for the analysis of 91 pesticide residues, which was qualitatively validated and applied to tea screening in the circulation market. By analyzing the collected pesticide certified reference materials (CRM), a mass spectral database of 91 pesticides was constructed. The database contains multiple types of information, including formulas, theoretical exact masses, retention times, characteristic fragment ions, and adduct types. The samples were extracted with acetonitrile, purified on a solid-phase extraction column, and separated on an Acquity BEH C18 column. All the data (ESI+) were acquired in MS<sup>E</sup> mode and analyzed using the UNIFI information system. Analyte detection was based on the retention time deviation ±0.1 min, accurate mass deviation ±5×10<sup>-6</sup>, and major adduct forms including[M+H]<sup>+</sup>,[M+Na]<sup>+</sup>,[M+K]<sup>+</sup>, and[M+NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>. Screening was performed by the software in an automated fashion. Compound identification was accomplished with retention time matching and accurate mass measurements of the primary diagnostic ions for each analyte. To ensure accuracy of the identification results, information from the MS/MS profiles must be compared with online mass spectral libraries such as PubChem and MassBank. The SANTE/11813/2017 protocol for the validation of the screening method was followed. A mixed standard solution was spiked to 21 tea samples at four levels (0.01 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.10 mg/kg, and 0.20 mg/kg) to determine the screening detection limit (SDL) of each pesticide, and a total of 1911 pesticide/sample combinations were evaluated. The results revealed 66 pesticides with an SDL of 0.01 mg/kg, eight pesticides with an SDL of 0.05 mg/kg, one pesticide with an SDL of 0.10 mg/kg, three pesticides with an SDL of 0.20 mg/kg, and 13 pesticides with an SDL greater than 0.20 mg/kg. One pesticide showed matrix-inhibitory effects in the screening tests. Finally, the established method was used to analyze the pesticide residues in 22 tea samples available on the market. Six pesticide compounds were found in the tea samples, all of which were confirmed to be positive after artificial identification. This method provides a reference for the high-throughput screening and detection of pesticide residues in tea as well as a research approach for the analysis of various chemical contaminants in other matrices.",

        "abstract": "A method for the determination of 10 pyrethroid pesticide residues in tea was established by multi-plug filtration cleanup (m-PFC) method combined with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Different extraction solvents (acetonitrile, acetone and ethyl acetate) and extraction methods (immersion without water and immersion with water) were compared. The effect of two kinds of QuEChERS pipes and m-PFC column on the purification of tea extracts and the pesticide recoveries were compared. The results showed that the tea samples could be extracted most efficiently when using acetonitrile without immersion in water. The m-PFC column had a good purification effect on the tea extract and could guarantee a high recovery rate. Good linear relationships were observed for the 10 pyrethroid pesticides, and the correlation coefficients (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) were greater than0.9980. The average recoveries for the 10 pyrethroid pesticides were in the range of 87.5%-111.3% at four spiked levels, and the RSDs were in the range of 2.1%-8.9%. The LODs and LOQs were 0.001-0.015 mg/kg and 0.003-0.05 mg/kg, respectively. The method was applied to the determination of the 10 pyrethroid pesticides in 50 tea samples. The detection rate of the pyrethroid pesticides was 48%, but all the pesticide residues were below the national standard limits. Compared with the traditional QuEChERS and solid phase extraction methods, this method has the advantages of operational simplicity as well as high accuracy and good precision. The establishment of this method provides a new strategy for the rapid detection of pyrethroid pesticide residues in tea.",

        "abstract": "Fenazaquin is a non-systemic acaricide/insecticide used widely in controlling mites and other related pests in fruits, vegetables and tea. The objective of this research was to investigate the disappearance trend in tea of fenazaquin residue level and its transfer in brew. Fenazaquin was applied on a tea crop at two rates, 125 and 250 g AI/ha in wet and dry seasons under field conditions. Samples (green shoots, made tea and its brew) were analyzed for fenazaquin and quantification was by high performance liquid chromatography using a UV detector. The residue dissipated faster in the wet season than in the dry season. Seven days after the treatment (normal round of plucking) the residues observed in the green shoots at the two rates were 2.17, 3.07 mg/kg and 2.04, 2.84 mg/kg in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. However, the degradation rale in both seasons followed first-order kinetics. Half-lives in green shoots were in range 1.43-1.70 and 2.10-2.21 days and in made tea 1.59-1.73 and 1.87-1.94 days for wet and dry seasons, respectively. During processing of green shoots to made tea considerable loss (42-70%) of residue was observed. The transfer of residue from made tea brew was in the range 3-22%. In brew residue were below 0.02 mg/l after 5 days of application at both the rates in either of the seasons. The estimated intake with brew (normal consumption of 10 cup/day/adult) thus would be below the acceptable daily intake for fenazaquin (0.005 mg/kg-body weight). To avoid health hazards due to the toxic effect of residues in brew, a waiting period for plucking the tea shoots after fenazaquin application of more than 5 days for both the seasons at recommended rate (125 g AI/ha) may be suggested and considered quite safe.",

In Stage I, different SPE cartridges C18, graphite carbon black (GCB), primary secondary amine (PSA), and amino (NH2) were purchased and combined into 12 different sequences. Through the comparative test on cleanup efficiency of 84 representative pesticides in tea, Envi-Carb GCB + PSA with a good cleanup effect was selected. In Stage II, GC/MS test results from the comparative study of the extraction efficiency of 201 pesticides spiked into green tea and Woolong tea with Cleanert TPT and Envi-Carb + PSA SPE showed that average recoveries fell within 70-110% and RSD <20% for 193 and 184 pesticides, respectively, for green tea, accounting for 96.0 and 91.0% of the total number, respectively. GC/MS/MS test results also found 193 and 184 pesticides, respectively, meeting the recovery and RSD conditions, accounting for 96.0 and 91.5%, respectively, of the total number. For Woolong tea samples, GC/MS results showed that with Cleanert TPT and Envi-Carb + PSA SPE for cleanup, there were 192 and 177 pesticides, respectively, meeting the conditions, accounting for 95.5 and 88.1% of the total number, respectively. GC/MS/MS results demonstrated that there were 195 and 184 pesticides, respectively, meeting the conditions, accounting for 97.0 and 91.5% of the total number, respectively. It was seen that Cleanert TPT was superior to Envi-Carb + PSA in cleanup efficiency, whether for green or Woolong tea samples, or GC/MS or GC/MS/MS determination. In Stage III, 61104 results of the average content value of pesticides and RSD (two teas xtwo Youden pair concentrations x two kinds of SPE cartridges x two instruments x 19 tests x 201 pesticides) were derived from the 19 times stability tests over 3 months by paralleling three samples every 5 days via two instruments with two kinds of SPE cartridges for cleanup, respectively, against Youden Pair samples of the 201 incurred pesticides from green and Woolong teas. The statistical analysis found that detected values from the target pesticides of the incurred Youden pair samples showed no marked differences with cleanup by either Cleanert TPT or Envi-Carb + PSA, whether for green or Woolong tea, or G/IMS or G/IM/IMS. The test results using the two aforementioned kinds of SPE cleanup for above 93% pesticides had a tolerance less than 15%, which testifies that both cartridge cleanups met the requirement for pesticide residue analysis.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a study of the extraction efficiency for the multiresidue pesticides and chemical pollutants in tea with three methods over three stages. Method 1 adopts the Pang et al. approach: the targets were extracted with 1% acetic acid in acetonitrile and cleaned up with a Cleanert TPT SPE cartridge; Method 2 adopts the QuEChERS approach: the targets were cleaned up dispersively with graphitized carbon and primary-secondary amine (PSA) sorbent; Method 3 adopts the relatively commonly used approach of hydration for solid samples, with tea hydrated before being extracted through salting out with acetonitrile and the cleanup procedures identical to those of Method 1. The three stages comprised two phases of comparative tests on spike recoveries of 201 pesticides and chemical pollutants from different teas and a third phase on determination of the content of the 201 pesticides and chemical pollutants from aged tea samples. In stages I and II, test results of the spike recoveries of 201 pesticides and chemical pollutants demonstrated that 91.4% of the pesticide and chemical pollutant recoveries fell within the range of 70-110%, and 93.2% of the pesticides and chemical pollutants had RSD < 15%, with no marked difference obtained by Method 1 and Method 2 regardless of whether it was green tea or woolong tea, or GC/MS or GC/MS/MS was used for analysis. For pigment removal, Method 1 was superior to Method 2; in terms of easy operation, Method 2 outweighed Method 1. However, Method 3 obtained relatively low recoveries, with 94% of pesticide and chemical pollutant recoveries less than 70%, which proved that Method 3 was not applicable to the determination of multiresidue pesticides and chemical pollutants in tea. Stage III made a comparison of Method 1 and Method 2 for the extraction efficiency of pesticides and chemical pollutants in 165-day-aged samples of green and woolong tea. Test results showed that 94% of the pesticide and chemical pollutant content in the aged tea samples was recovered with Method 1, more than 10% higher than with Method 2 (30-50% higher on average). For green tea, 193 (GC/MS/MS) and 197 (GC/MS) pesticides and chemical pollutants accounted for 96.5% (GC/MS/MS) and 98.0% (GC/MS) with Method 1 higher than with Method 2. For woolong tea, 191 (GC/MS/MS) and 194 (GC/MS) pesticides and chemical pollutants accounted for 95% (GC/MS/MS) and 96% (GC/MS/MS) with Method 1, higher than with Method 2, respectively. In other words, there were definite differences in the test results for aged tea samples between Method 1 and Method 2, which suggests that Method 1 was capable of extracting more residual pesticides and chemical pollutants from the precipitated 165-day-aged tea samples. The reason can be traced to the possibility that Method 1 (high-speed homogenizing) has better extraction efficiency than Method 2 (vortex and oscillation). Therefore, Method 1 was chosen as the sample preparation technique for multiresidue pesticide and chemical pollutant analysis in tea.",

The recoveries of 162 pesticides from fortified (at 0.01 mg kg(-1)) green tea, oolong tea, black tea and matcha (powdered green tea) were mostly (95-98% of the tested pesticides) within the range of 70-120%, with relative standard deviations of <20%. Poor recovery of triazole pesticides was considered to be due to low recovery from the silica gel cartridges. The test solutions obtained by the modified method contained relatively small amounts of pigments, caffeine and other matrix components and were cleaner than those obtained by the original Japanese official multiresidue method. No interfering peaks were observed in the blank chromatograms, indicating the high selectivity of the modified method.

        "abstract": "Pyrethroids (PYs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are widely used to control pests and diseases in plants; however, they threaten human health. In this study, a metal-organic framework/carbon-nitrogen nanosheet composite nanomaterial (UiO-66/HOCN)-coated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber was prepared by in-situ thermal polymerization. The prepared UiO-66/HOCN composite material was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption porosimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and zeta potentiometry. The prepared UiO-66/HOCN composite-coated MSPE fiber was used for the enrichment and separation of OCPs and PYs, which showed good thermal and chemical stability as well as high extraction efficiency. Combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), an efficient and sensitive method for the detection of trace levels of OCPs and PYs was developed. Under the optimal experimental conditions, wide linear ranges (0.1-800.0 ng/L), good linearity (≥ 0.9978), low limits of detection (0.03-0.30 ng/L), and acceptable repeatability (RSD ≤ 8.9%, <i>n</i>=3) were obtained. Typical black tea samples were analyzed by the developed method, and trace levels of aldrin (6.6 ng/g), <i>α</i> -endosulfan (54.7 ng/g), and bifenthrin (185.8 ng/g) were detected. The results demonstrate that the developed method has immense potential for the detection of pesticides in a complicated matrix.",

The pesticide residues in tea were extracted using acetone/<i>n</i>-hexane (1:1, v/v) for 5 min at 100℃ before preheating the extraction pool for 3 min, under extractive pressure of 10 MPa for one cycle. After extraction, the extraction pool was washed with acetone/<i>n</i>-hexane (1:1, v/v) having volume of 40% of the pool volume, followed by purging for 100 s with nitrogen. The extract was purified by a Cleanert TPT solid-phase extraction column. After purification, the target compounds were detected by GC-MS/MS and quantified by the external standard method.

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to investigate the loss/stability of neonicotinoids (imidacloprid and acetamiprid) residues during the manufacture of black tea and to study the transfer of these pesticides from made tea to its infusion. For orthodox black tea, the manufacturing process involves leaf harvesting (plucking two leaves and a bud), withering, rolling, fermentation (oxidation), and drying. Initial withering and final drying resulted in the loss of pesticide residues, but no significant reduction in residue levels resulted from the rolling and fermentation steps. The drying process resulted in a residue transfer of 64-70% and 69-74% of the initial level, whereas the brewing process resulted in a residue transfer of 37-39% and 45-49% of imidacloprid and acetamiprid, respectively, from dried tea into the infusion. The decrease in acetamiprid levels during drying was also significant (8-13%), whereas the total loss during the manufacturing process ranged from 26 to 31%. Further, brewing for longer periods (an extended brewing time) resulted in higher transfer (up to 44% for imidacloprid and 53% for acetamiprid) of pesticides to tea infusion. Further, the extent of pesticide leaching depends on its water solubility, partition coefficient, and the brewing time.",

The purification effects and dosages of four carbon nanomaterials, viz. single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), MWCNTs, amino-modified MWCNTs, and graphene, were compared. An orthogonal experimental design was used to determine the optimal experimental conditions for sample pretreatment. The experimental factors governing the process were analyzed using variance. The results showed that the optimized sample pretreatment parameters were as follows. Acetonitrile was used as the extraction solvent with ultrasonic extraction for 35 min, while 60 mg MWCNTs, 200 mg PSA, and 200 mg C18, were used as purifiers. The effects of the extraction solvent and the carbon nanomaterials used on the recoveries of the 10 pyrethroid pesticides were significantly different (<i>p</i><0.001), and the effect of extraction time on the recoveries was statistically different (<i>p</i><0.05). The dosage of carbon nanomaterials had no significant effect on the recoveries (<i>p</i>>0.05). Good linearities were observed for the 10 pyrethroid pesticides in the concentration range of 0.01-2 mg/L. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were in the ranges of 0.001-0.01 mg/kg and 0.005-0.04 mg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries of the pyrethroid pesticides spiked into blank samples of green tea were 91.4%-109.7%, and the relative standard deviations were 0.12%-9.80% (<i>n</i>=6). Furthermore, the matrix effects (MEs) of scented green tea, green tea, and black tea were evaluated. It was found that the addition of MWCNTs to the purifier can effectively reduce the matrix effect in green tea and black tea matrices. The developed method and the national standard method were used to detect the residues of the 10 pyrethroid pesticides in 120 tea samples available in the market. The results showed that cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin, fenpropathrin, cypermethrin, bifenthrin and cyhalothrin were detected, and the contents obtained with the two methods were similar. Although pyrethroids were detected in most tea samples, the contents of all pesticide residues were below the maximum residue limits (MRLs). Therefore, the developed method is suitable for the rapid quantitative analysis of pesticide residues in tea.",

Quantification was achieved using matrix-matched standard calibration curves with isotopically labeled standards or a chemical analog as internal standards in an analytical range from 5 to 500 microg/kg. The LC/ESI-MS/MS served as a reliable tool to quantify the pesticides due to its superior sensitivity and good repeatability.

The results indicate that in terms of Youden pair ratios of 201 pesticide aged tea samples falling approximately within 1.00-1.20 of the ratio of theoretical spraying concentrations, the differences do not exceed 5% for percentages made up by ratios of the fixed values obtained by two kinds of instruments for two teas and those made up by 18 circular determinations. However, regarding two kinds of SPE cartridges, the Cleanert TPT cartridge is higher than the ENVI-CARB+primary secondary amine (PSA) cartridge by 10%. Pertaining to RSD values of \"parallel samples\" and whether it is green tea or Woolong tea, the percentages of RSD≤15% values of the parallel samples all exceed 88%. Whether it is the first or circular determination for two teas and analytical results from two kinds of instruments, the percentages of RSD≤15% values have a difference of less than 6%, while the TPT cartridge is better than ENVI-CARB+PSA by above 6% for the two cartridges. Concerning RSDs of Youden pair ratios, RSD≤15% values have a proportion exceeding 85% for both green tea and Woolong tea, and the percentage is greater than 87% whether it is for two kinds of SPE cartridges or two kinds of instruments. In terms of Youden pair ratios and the classified statistical analysis of the ruggedness data of parallel samples, the proportion of RSD≤15% values of Youden pair ratios is 8% higher for the TPT cartridge than the ENVI-CARB+PSA cartridge; the proportion of RSD≤15% values of parallel samples is 6.2% higher for the TPT cartridge than the ENVI-CARB+PSA cartridge.

        "abstract": "Long-term exposure to pyrethroid insecticides is detrimental to the nervous system, reproductive system, and immune system in humans. Therefore, enrichment detection of pyrethroid pesticides is imperative. In this study, a novel carbonyl-iron powder composite silica monolithic column was first prepared for the enrichment of pyrethroid pesticide residues in tea samples. Then, the target analytes were thermally desorbed and online-injected into a gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) system. In the present method, hydroxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was covalently bonded to the surface of the SiO<sub>2</sub> network and subsequently bonded with the carbonyl-iron powder. After the target analytes were adsorbed and concentrated in the PDMS spots, high-frequency induction heating was used for GC-MS/MS sampling. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limits of the pyrethroid pesticide residues were 3.8 to 7.5 μg/kg, and the relative standard deviation was 3.2% to 6.8% (<i>n</i>=6). The extraction recovery ranged from 97.7% to 110.5%, and the correlation coefficient was ≥ 0.9960. In addition, the enrichment factor could reach 1000 times. PDMS materials show excellent adsorption properties for non-polar solutes. In our experiment, carbonyl iron powder-bonded monolithic columns were prepared on the basis of stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE). Carbonyl iron powder magnetic particles were evenly implanted into the inorganic-organic hybrid cassia material for realizing rapid and uniform desorption upon electromagnetic induction heating. Under the premise of perfectly integrating the technical advantages of SBSE and solid-phase microextraction (SPME), the electromagnetic induction characteristics of carbonyl iron powder can be exploited for thermal desorption and directly combined with GC-MS to facilitate online analysis and solvent-free elution. Compared with the conventional SPME method, the proposed method has the advantages of high enrichment factor, large adsorption capacity of the column, reusability, high degree of automation, and good universality. This method has high significance for sample preparation and for the extraction of pesticide residues in complex matrices.",

The sensitivity of a method of analysis depends greatly on the efficient extraction of the pesticide and the subsequent clean-up of the extract. The extract from green tea leaves is a mixture of aroma components, polyphenols and caffeine. The preparation of made tea from green tea leaves adds to this complexity by concentrating these coextractives. Conventional clean-up techniques provide poor recoveries for parathion-methyl and chlorpyrifos from both green tea leaves and made tea. This arises from interference by caffeine during gas chromatography, as it has a similar retention time to the two pesticides and peaks overlap. A modification to the protocol based on a solvent partitioning process using dichloromethane and subsequent washing of the extracts with warm water removed the caffeine, and pigments were removed by column chromatography. Recoveries ranging from 80 to 90% were then obtained for both pesticides.",

The authors conducted a quality-assurance evaluation of residual organochlorine pesticides in some popular brands of Indian herbal teas. Organochlorine pesticide residue build-up from agricultural or storage practices was estimated with gas-liquid chromatography. The results revealed scant presence of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or its metabolites; endosulfan--a highly toxic pesticide--was absent in all 8 brands of herbal teas studied. Hexachlorocyclohexane isomers were detected in 2 samples, but levels were below the permissible limit for pesticide residue in foods, as promulgated by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

        "abstract": "A multiresidue analysis of pesticides in tea using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and GC-MS was developed. The preprocessing using SFE shortened the total analysis time. The SFE extract contained less matrices than the extract obtained with organic solvents. However, these matrices disturbed instrumental analysis. So, the extract was cleaned up with ENVI™-Carb/NH2 and InertSep™ SI cartridge. A recovery test was carried out for 245 pesticides spiked in samples at the level of 0.1 μg/g. Recovery rates of 178 pesticides ranged from 70 to 120%, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 15%, and quantitation limits were between 0.01 and 0.05 μg/g. Based on these results, this method is considered to be useful for multiresidue analysis of pesticides in tea samples.",

        "abstract": "The pesticide residues in exported and imported tea products must not exceed the maximum residue limits (MRLs) regulated by the import countries. Tea is a complex matrix that obfuscates the determination of pesticide residues. Many available methods for multiresidue pesticide analysis of tea are time-consuming and require many cleanup steps. The objective of this study was to develop a simple multiresidue method by using a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction and ion-trap GC/MS/MS, which can identify, confirm, and quantify pesticides in complex matrixes. A tea product was homogenized with water, and the pesticides were extracted with acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid. The extract was subjected to centrifugation, initial cleanup with dispersive SPE (dSPE), solvent exchange, and final cleanup with dSPE. Diethyl-d10-parathion and triphenyl phosphate were used as the internal standard and surrogate, respectively. The final extract was injected into an ITQ 700 gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. Quantitation of individual pesticides was based on matrix-matched calibration curves with a correlation coefficient of > 0.9930 for the 22 pesticides selected for the study. The recoveries of the 22 pesticides ranged from 78 to 115%, except those for diazinon (130%) and malathion (122%), with an average RSD of 8.7%. The LOD values of all of the pesticides, except for terbufos, were below the MRLs set by the European Union and Japan.",

Analysis of the residual insecticides was carried out using high-pressure liquid chromatography with a post-column fluorescence detector. Results showed that in the tea field carbofuran dissipated faster then carbaryl. Manufacturing processes of Oolong tea further reduced the carbofuran and carbaryl contents. The persistence of carbofuran and carbaryl was decreased with increasing roasting temperature.

A data base of the accurate mass numbers and a library which contains the 204 pesticides were established. The automatic retrieval of detection results was carried on according to the characteristics of the compound, such as accurate mass, retention time, isotopic ratio, and so on. Based on the above results, the qualitative identifications of the 204 pesticides were accomplished without the contrast of standard substances. The results indicated that this method can be used to determine the 204 pesticides in tea.

Optimizations of different parameters, such as the type of extraction solvents, clean-up cartridges, and elution solvents were carried out. The developed method used acetonitrile as extraction solvent, amino cartridge for adsorbents and acetone-n-hexane as the eluting solution. Nineteen carbamate residues were then analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detector. The present results showed good linearity by correlation coefficients of more than 0.9999 for all analyses. Limits of detection and quantification varied from 0.0005-0.023 mg L(- 1), 0.008-0.077 mg L(- 1), respectively. Recoveries of sixteen carbamate pesticides ranged from 65% to 135% at the spiked level of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg L(- 1).

        "abstract": "The issue of residues including organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides in tea has made a great attention of researchers and customers in the world. Although some analytical methods have well been established to detect these pesticides, the sample preparations are generally laborious, time-consuming, and some of the procedures caused environmental pollution. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is a novel sample preparation technique since it is of simplicity, high efficiency and solvent free. SPME was firstly developed to address the need to facilitate environment monitoring. In recent years, great efforts have been made in the analysis of pesticide residues in agricultural products by SPME. In this research, a microwave assisted extraction solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography (MAE-SPME-GC) was applied for the simultaneous determination of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides, such as benzene hexa chlorides (alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, gamma-BHC and delta-BHC), 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2, 2, 2-trichloroethane (o, p'-DDT), 2, 2-bis (4-chlorophenyl)-1, 1-dichloroethylene (DDE), 2, 2-bis (4-chlorophenyl)-1, 1-dichloroethane (DDD), 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1, 1, 1-trichloroethane (p, p'-DDT), cypermethrin and fenvalerate. All the tested pesticides were baseline separated under the experimental conditions, except for DDD and o, p'-DDT. The concentration of each pesticide was calibrated by external standard method. The linearities were found to be in the correlation coefficient range of 0.970 5 to 0.998 4 for the tested pesticides between the mass concentrations and peak areas, except for fenvalerate. The recoveries, relative standard deviations and detection limits for the 10 pesticides were 64% - 121%, 10.4% -22.9%, and 1 - 50 ng/L, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of organochlorine pesticide residues in three kinds of teas from the local market. The experimental results demonstrated that MAE-SPME-GC was a fast, sensitive and green technique for the analysis of trace quantity of pesticides in solid substrate foods.",

By comparison of the two techniques, the selectivity of NCI-SIM was much better than that of EI-SIM method. The sensitivities of the both techniques were high, the limit of quantitative (LOQ) for each herbicide was no more than 2.0 microg/kg, and the limit of detection (LOD) with NCI-SIM technique was much lower than that of EI-SIM when analyzing herbicides with several halogen atoms in the molecule.",

A systematic study of the effects of pretreatment methods including extraction and purification procedures was designed and carried out for the determination of GLY, GLUF, and AMPA. The results indicated that the optimal pretreatment method was as follows:the tea sample was first extracted by water in vortex, and then purified by a cation exchange solid-phase extraction column with the elution of 0.5% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution. Finally, the eluant was derivatized by 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate, and the target compounds were separated on a C<sub>18</sub> chromatographic column and analysed by UPLC-MS/MS (ESI<sup>+</sup>).

To identify glyphosate and its metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), in the difficult-to-analyze matrix of tea, new methods were developed. The main emphasis was placed on the cleanup procedure. Two different solid-phase extraction methods were tested and evaluated: one with molecularly imprinted polymers, and the other with immobilized titanium dioxide. The optimization was carried out on the basis of aqueous standard solutions and spiked tea extracts. Validated results were presented for pipet tips that contained immobilized titanium dioxide. After the extraction of glyphosate from tea samples using hydrochloric acid (0.1%), glyphosate and AMPA were concentrated on the adsorbent by pipetting up and down several times without changing the tip. The elution was carried out subsequent to a washing step with 5% ammonia. The extract was derivatized with 2,2,2-trifluoroacetic acid and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and then analyzed by GC with MS detection in the negative chemical ionization mode. Quantification was carried out in the selected-ion monitoring mode based on the m/z ratio of characteristic ions due to the ionization process. For glyphosate m/z = 370 was applied, and m/z = 351 for AMPA. The detection limit was 0.03 mg/kg tea for glyphosate and 0.006 mg/kg tea for AMPA. The recoveries for the tested working range (0.1 to 2.8 mg/kg tea) were low but constant at 14 and 12%, respectively.

However, with the increasingly stringent pesticide testing standards in the import and export trade of tea, there is an urgent need for methods to detect trace amounts of PYs in tea. In this study, a covalent organic framework (COF) material TpBD with excellent thermal/chemical stability, high porosity, and a large specific surface area was prepared by a room-temperature solution-suspension approach (SSA). TpBD-coated solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers were fabricated by coating the material on etched stainless-steel fibers by a simple physical coating method. The fibers were used in combination with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) to establish a highly sensitive method for the detection of PYs. The enrichment factors of this method for cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, flucythrinate, fenvalerate, and deltamethrin were 702-2687. The method showed low LODs (0.1-0.5 ng/L), wide linear ranges (0.2-800 ng/L), good linearities (correlation coefficients (<i>R</i>)≥0.9991) and acceptable repeatabilities (RSD≤11.0%, <i>n</i>=3). Green tea and oolong tea samples were analyzed using the developed method, and trace levels of the five PYs were successfully detected. The recoveries of the spiked PYs in the real green tea and oolong tea samples were in the range of 80.2%-109.5%. Experimental results showed that the established analytical method is suitable for the determination of PY pesticides in tea. Furthermore, the TpBD material was successfully prepared by the SSA method, demonstrating that the method has good universality and excellent potential for the simple synthesis of other COF materials.",

The prediction results are compared with SVR and SVR coupled with several preprocessing methods, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in the quantitative detection of thiamethoxam in tea.",

The target compounds were extracted with 1% (v/v) acetic acid-acetonitrile and 1 g ammonium acetate, and purified by 4 g MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05 g C18, 0.50 g primary secondary amine (PSA) sorbent and 0.05 g graphitized carbon black (GCB). The 0.1% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile were used as the mobile phases. The extracts were separated on a Venusil MP C18 chromatographic column using a positive electrospray ionization (ESI) and negative ESI source under the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The analytes were quantified by the matrix match standard solutions. The good linearities were obtained in the range of 0.5-100.0 μ g/L, and the correlation coefficients were all greater than 0.995. The average recoveries of the 77 pesticide residues ranged from 70.3% to 110.0%, and RSDs were in the range of 2.6%-9.8%. The limits of detection were 1.0-10.0 μ g/kg.

Vegetables and fruits were extracted with acetone, filtered after addition of coagulating solution, partitioned into n-hexane, and cleaned up on a Florisil column (as necessary). Pyrethroids were determined by gas chromatography/electron capture detection (GC/ECD) by using a methyl silicone-coated fused-silica capillary column, and recoveries were calculated by summing peak areas of the components. GC/mass spectrometry was used to identify the pyrethroids detected by GC/ECD monitoring. Grains and beans containing lipids were analyzed by extraction with acetonitrile, partition into n-hexane, Florisil column cleanup, and capillary GC/ECD. The coagulation method was suitable for nonfatty crops such as vegetables, fruits, and green tea leaves, because recoveries were good and Florisil column cleanup was not needed in most cases. The coagulation method was not applicable to lipid-containing crops such as grains and beans because of low recoveries. Recoveries for 18 crops at fortification levels of 0.25-1.0 ppm were 60.0-103.5%.

First, it was discovered from the mathematical correlation equation of 329 pesticide recoveries established and log Kow values that the extraction efficiency of hydration method M1 has obvious correlation with pesticide log Kow, making the extraction efficiency of M1 take the shape of an arc trend line with a certain arc hanging down from both ends of polar pesticides and nonpolar pesticides. Second, regarding the M1 method, the interfering matter after co-extraction increased in large quantities, which markedly lowered the S/N of the target pesticides and method sensitivity, leading to an obvious decrease of the method efficiency. The fortification experiment of the uniform limit 0.010 mg/kg proved that with the M1 hydration method there are 23 pesticides with recoveries between 70 and 120% and RSD<20%, accounting for only 5.0%, while with nonhydration method M3 there are 229 pesticides, making up 50%.",

Participants represented government regulatory, commercial testing, university, research institute, and private laboratories. The single-laboratory validated (SLV) tea method was evaluated in the collaborative study to determine the recovery and reproducibility of the method under multilaboratory conditions. Since there were no restrictions regarding the type of analytical instrumentation to use for the analyses, laboratories used a combination of equipment that included GC/MS, GC/MS/MS, and LC/MS/MS instruments from 22 different manufacturers, 21 brands of GC and LC columns, 13 different GC temperature programming profiles, 11 LC gradient elution programs, and six different vendor manufactured SPE cartridges. Even though all the analytical performance parameters for all the 653 compounds had been determined in the SLV study, guidance was obtained from an expert review panel of the AOAC Method-Centric Committee on Pesticide Residues to conduct the multilaboratory collaborative study based on 20 selected compounds that can be analyzed by GC/MS and 20 compounds that can be analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Altogether, 560 samples covering the 40 selected pesticides were analyzed in the study. These samples included green tea and oolong tea samples fortified typically at the European Union maximum residue limit for regulatory guidance and compliance, aged tea samples incurred with 20 pesticides, and green tea and oolong tea samples incurred with five pesticides. The analysis of the 560 samples generated a total of 82 459 test results by the 30 participating laboratories. One laboratory failed to meet the proficiency requirements in the precollaborative study. Therefore, its data submitted for the collaborative study were excluded from further analysis and interpretation. The results presented are therefore the 6638 analytical results obtained from the 29 remaining laboratories, which included 1977 results generated by GC/MS, 1704 results by GC/MS/MS, and 2957 results by LC/MS/MS. It was determined after application of the Grubbs and Dixon tests for outliers to the data sets that there were 65 outlier results from the 1977 GC/MS results (3.3%), 65 outlier results from the 1704 GC/MS/MS results (3.8%), and 57 outlier results out of 2957 LC/MS/MS results (1.9%), representing 0.98, 0.98, and 0.86%, respectively, of the 6638 results generated in the study. Analysis with the AOAC statistical software package also confirmed that the method is rugged, and average recovery, average concentration, RSDr, RSDR, and HorRat values all meet recovery and reproducibility criteria for use in multiple laboratories. The Study Director is recommending this method for adoption as an AOAC First Action Official MethodSM.",

        "abstract": "Separation of radioactive metabolites in cultured tea cells fed with [14C]phenylalanine was conducted using high-speed counter-current chromatography. Among seven components obtained our studies focused two metabolites, i.e. (-)-epicatechin and D,L-catechin. The specific radioactivity of (-)-epicatechin was 212.01 KBq/mg, amounting to 8.5% of the total radioactivity of ethyl acetate extract while that of D,L-catechin was 1.0006 MBq/mg or 5.4% of the total.",
